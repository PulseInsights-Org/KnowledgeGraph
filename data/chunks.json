Depreciation is calculated using the written down value method based on the useful lives of the assets as estimated by the management, in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. The useful lives for different categories of assets are specified, such as 30 years for buildings, 15 years for plant and machinery, and 3 years for computers. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The residual values, useful lives, and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Gains or losses on the derecognition of assets are included in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost, and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic life, and the amortization period and method are reviewed annually. Gains or losses from derecognizing intangible assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the asset's cost. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains) a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments. The Group's lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for Buildings. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (\u201cROU\u201d) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.\n\nInventories, including raw materials, packing materials, stores, spares, and consumables, are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Work-in-progress and finished goods are also valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value."
