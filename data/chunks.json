The consolidation procedure involves combining like items, offsetting the parent's investment in subsidiaries, eliminating intragroup transactions, and accounting for non-controlling interests. Changes in ownership without loss of control are treated as equity transactions, while loss of control results in derecognition of assets and liabilities, recognition of fair values, and reclassification of OCI components.

Fair value measurement is based on the principal or most advantageous market accessible by the Group, using assumptions that market participants would use. The fair value hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities into three levels based on the observability of inputs: Level 1 (quoted market prices), Level 2 (observable inputs), and Level 3 (unobservable inputs). Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date, with monetary items re-translated at the end of each reporting period. Exchange differences are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Revenue recognition primarily occurs when control of goods is transferred to the customer, typically upon delivery. The Group also derives revenue from job work contracts, recognized when services are rendered. Revenue is derived from fixed price contracts, with no significant variable consideration. Export incentives are recognized on an accrual basis, and interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the dividend is established. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use."

    "chunk_summary": "This section of the Annual Report FY23-24 of Gokaldas Exports Limited outlines the accounting policies related to assets held for sale, government grants, taxes on income, and property, plant, and equipment (PPE).  \n\n**Assets Held for Sale:** An asset is classified as held for sale when it is available for immediate sale in its present condition, its sale is highly probable, and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The sale is considered highly probable when management is committed to a sale plan, an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, the asset is actively marketed at a reasonable price, the sale is expected to be completed within one year, and there are no likely significant changes to the plan. Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\n**Government Grants:** Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with and the grants will be received. Grants related to assets are treated as income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon fulfilment of the conditions, and are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet by deducting the grant from the carrying amount of the asset. Grants related to revenue are recognized systematically in the statement of profit and loss to match them with the related costs they are intended to compensate. Export incentives are recognized on an accrual basis according to the schemes formulated by the Government of India, provided there is reasonable assurance of compliance with the attached conditions.\n\n**Taxes on Income:** Tax expense includes current and deferred tax. Current income tax is based on the taxable profit for the year, calculated using enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and laws. Current income tax related to items recognized outside profit or loss is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) or equity. Deferred tax is recognized on differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, using the balance sheet liability model. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that future taxable profits will be available to utilize temporary differences, unused tax credits, and tax losses. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates expected to apply when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on enacted or substantively enacted tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and they relate to the same taxable entity and taxation authority. Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in India is recognized as a deferred tax asset if it is probable that future economic benefits will be realized.\n\n**Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):** On transitioning to Ind AS, Gokaldas Exports Limited elected to continue with the carrying value of its PPE as of March 31, 2016, measured according to previous GAAP, as the deemed cost on April 1, 2016. Freehold land is carried at historical cost and is not depreciated. Capital work-in-progress and other PPE are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Historical cost includes directly attributable acquisition expenditures. Subsequent costs are included in the asset\u2019s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset when future economic benefits are probable and the cost can be measured reliably. Components with significantly different useful lives are depreciated separately, while other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit and loss as incurred."

    "chunk_summary": "These notes to the consolidated financial statements of Gokaldas Exports Limited for the year ended March 31, 2024, detail the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements. Depreciation is calculated using the written down value method based on the useful lives of the assets as estimated by the management, aligning with the rates under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. The useful lives for different asset categories are specified, such as 30 years for buildings, 15 years for plant and machinery, and 3 years for computers. Leasehold improvements are amortized over their useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The residual values, useful lives, and depreciation methods are reviewed annually.\n\nIntangible assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic life, and both the amortization period and method are reviewed annually. Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of the asset's cost. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. The determination of whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception of the lease. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\nFor leases entered into before April 1, 2016, the company determined whether the arrangement contained a lease based on the facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition. Leased assets under finance leases are depreciated over the asset's useful life, or the lease term if ownership is not reasonably certain. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (\u201cROU\u201d) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.\n\nInventories, including raw materials, packing materials, stores, spares, and consumables, are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost determined on a weighted average basis. Work-in-progress and finished goods are also valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value."

Retirement benefits, such as provident fund and employee state insurance, are defined contribution schemes, with contributions recognized as expenditure. Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation funded through Life Insurance Corporation of India policies and is actuarially valued. Share-based payments to employees are accounted for as equity-settled transactions, with costs determined by fair value at the grant date and recognized over the service period."

Service and non-market performance conditions are assessed to estimate the number of equity instruments that will vest, while market performance conditions are reflected in the grant date fair value. Non-vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value and lead to immediate expensing unless service or performance conditions exist. No expense is recognized for awards that do not vest due to unmet non-market performance or service conditions. Modifications to equity-settled awards result in recognizing a minimum expense equivalent to the original terms, with additional expenses for modifications increasing the fair value or benefiting the employee. Financial instruments are recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contract, initially measured at transaction cost and fair value. The effective interest method is used to calculate the amortized cost of financial instruments and allocate interest income or expense. Financial assets are measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income based on the business model and contractual terms. Impairment of financial assets is recognized using expected credit losses. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified based on the substance of contractual arrangements. Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method."
