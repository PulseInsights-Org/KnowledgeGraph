**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**
In this Annual Report, we have disclosed forward-looking information to enable investors to comprehend our prospects and make
informed investment decisions. This report and other statements - written and oral - that we periodically make, contain forward-
looking statements that set out anticipated results based on the management’s plans and assumptions. We have tried wherever
possible to identify such statements by using words such as ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘expects’, ‘projects’,‘intends’, ‘plans’,
‘believes’, and words of similar substance in connection with any discussion of future performance. We cannot guarantee that
these forward-looking statements will be realised, although we believe we have been prudent in assumptions. The achievement
of results is subject to risks, uncertainties and even inaccurate assumptions. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties
materialise or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those anticipated,
estimated or projected. Readers should bear this in mind. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward- looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
# Integrate.
# Diversify.
# Grow.
## In the ever-evolving landscape
## of global apparel manufacturing,
## Gokaldas Exports Limited has
## embarked on a transformative
## journey encapsulated by themed
## vision: Integrate. Diversify. Grow.
Gokaldas Exports has made significant strides in
its journey towards business excellence. We have
streamlined our operations by ushering in far reaching
improvements to our manufacturing and investing in
digitalisation and automation. Investing judiciously for
consistent growth and obsessing on our customers
through continuous engagement, we have expanded
the business organically at a rate much faster than
the industry.
The recent strategic acquisitions of Atraco and Matrix
Design mark a pivotal moment in our history. By
integrating these entities, we’ve not only expanded
our geographical footprint but also embraced new
manufacturing paradigms. This integration goes
beyond mere consolidation; it’s about weaving
together diverse strengths to create a more resilient
and adaptable organisation.
Diversification has been the natural outcome of this
integration. With Atraco, we’ve gained a strong
presence in Africa, unlocking duty-free access to key
markets. Matrix Design has bolstered our position
in the high-value knitwear segment, opening doors
to new European and UK markets. These additions
have significantly broadened our product portfolio
and customer base, allowing us to navigate market
fluctuations with greater agility.
The ultimate goal of our strategy is sustainable
growth. By leveraging our expanded capabilities,
we’re poised to capitalise on the ongoing shift in
global sourcing patterns. Our enhanced scale and
diversified offerings position us favourably amidst the
consolidation trend towards efficient, well-capitalised
players.
As we move forward, our focus remains on realising
synergies, driving operational excellence, and
creating value for all stakeholders.
## This theme
## represents not just
## our strategy, but
## our commitment to
## evolving with the
## industry, embracing
## new opportunities,
## and cementing our
## position as a global
## leader in apparel
## manufacturing.

strategic moves have provided access to
new markets, expanded our customer
base, and strengthened our position in
key product categories. The integration
of these entities is progressing well,
and we expect to realise synergies in
the coming years.

on operational excellence and cost
optimisation, will enable us to meet
the growing demand from our global
customer base efficiently.

AHEAD FOR OUR ORGANISATION.
**INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND GLOBAL**
**TRENDS**
The global apparel industry is undergoing significant
transformations, driven by shifting consumer
preferences, technological advancements,
and geopolitical factors. The ongoing trend of
diversification away from China as a primary sourcing
hub has opened new avenues for countries like India
to expand their market share. This ‘China Plus One’
strategy adopted by major brands is reshaping the
global supply chain, presenting a unique opportunity
for Indian manufacturers.
Sustainability has emerged as a critical focus area for
the industry. Consumers, particularly in developed
markets, are increasingly demanding environmentally
responsible and ethically produced garments. This shift
is compelling brands to reassess their supply chains
and partner with manufacturers who can meet these
evolving standards.
The potential implementation of Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs) with key markets like the UK and
EU presents exciting prospects for increased textile
trade. Additionally, government initiatives such as the
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the Man-
Made Fibre (MMF) and technical textile ecosystem are
expected to boost investments in the sector.
include implementing energy-efficient
systems, reducing water consumption,
and minimising waste generation
across our manufacturing units. We are
proud to report significant progress in
our sustainability initiatives, including
a 20% decrease in water usage across
our facilities. Our comprehensive waste
management system has resulted in
80% of our waste being recycled or
repurposed.
Moreover, as a significant employer,
particularly of women, we contribute
to social upliftment and economic
development in the communities where
we operate. Our workforce of about
51,000 people, with a large proportion
being women, reflects our commitment
to creating equitable employment
opportunities and fostering a diverse
and inclusive work environment.
**LEVERAGING OUR**
**COMPETENCIES**
Gokaldas Exports’ strength lies in
its robust in-house capabilities,
encompassing skilled labour and
state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities.
Our integrated manufacturing facilities
enable us to be present across the
entire value chain, facilitating our ability
to cater to myriad requirements of our
customers. Our design and product
development capabilities, coupled with
our ability to handle complex styles and
small batch sizes, set us apart in the
industry. We have invested in advanced
technologies, including 3D design
capabilities and modern printing set-
ups, to enhance our product offerings
and improve efficiency.
**LOOKING AHEAD**
As we move forward, I am optimistic
about the future of Gokaldas Exports.
The inventory destocking cycle in
major markets is nearing its end, with
many fashion brands showing reduced
inventory levels, improved financial
performance, and a renewed appetite
for purchases. We expect this trend
to translate into stronger demand
for our products in the coming
quarters. Our focus remains on driving
operational excellence, realising
synergies from our acquisitions, and
capitalising on growth opportunities.
We are committed to enhancing
shareholder value through sustainable
growth, margin improvement,
and prudent capital allocation. In
conclusion, I would like to express my
heartfelt gratitude to our employees,
customers, suppliers, and shareholders
for their unwavering support. Your
trust and confidence in Gokaldas
Exports continue to be our greatest
strength as we navigate challenges
and seize opportunities in our journey
towards becoming a global leader in
the apparel manufacturing industry.
As we look ahead, our commitment
to sustainable growth, operational
excellence, and value creation for all
our stakeholders remains unwavering.
Together, we will continue to build
resilience, explore new opportunities,
and embrace sustainable growth in
the years to come.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE
AND FAITH IN GOKALDAS EXPORTS

This growth is particularly noteworthy given
that India’s overall apparel exports declined
by 10% during the same period. Our EBITDA
margin stood at 11.8% for the year, reflecting
the impact of newly acquired entities. While
facing cost pressures from increased statutory
minimum wages and start-up costs for new
units, we maintained our focus on operational
excellence and cost optimisation. Additionally,
our consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for FY24
was I 131 crores, compared to I 173 crores
in FY23, reflecting the challenging market
conditions and integration costs associated
with our recent acquisitions.
**EXPANDING HORIZONS THROUGH**
**STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS**
In line with our growth strategy, we completed two
significant acquisitions during the year – Atraco
and Matrix Design. These strategic moves have
expanded our product offerings, provided access to
low-cost manufacturing locations, and brought on
board new, high-value customers. The integration
of these entities is progressing well, and we expect
to realise synergies over the next 4-6 quarters.
Atraco, with its strong presence in Africa,
brings valuable duty-free access to key markets
and enhances our global footprint. The
acquisition, completed in January 2024, adds
five manufacturing facilities across Kenya and
Ethiopia, along with over 11,000 skilled workers
to our workforce. In the fourth quarter, Atraco
contributed I 201 crores to our revenue, with an
operating EBITDA of 5.7%.
Matrix Design strengthens our position in the
high-value knitwear segment and provides greater
access to European and UK markets. With five
manufacturing facilities in India and a workforce
of 4,500+, Matrix brings expertise in knitwear
manufacturing and a complementary customer
base. Although only 19 days of Matrix’s operations
were consolidated in Q4 FY24, we are optimistic
about its future contributions to our growth.
These acquisitions, totalling an investment of
I 934 crores, were funded through a combination
of debt and equity. I’m pleased to report that
we subsequently raised ₹ 600 crores through a
qualified institutional placement in April 2024,
which has restored our net cash position positive.
**INVESTING IN ORGANIC GROWTH**
We continue to invest in organic growth as well.
Our new manufacturing unit in Bhopal, Madhya
Pradesh, is ramping up well and is expected to
reach full capacity utilisation by early to mid-Q2
FY25. Currently operating at about 50% capacity
with 500 machines, we anticipate reaching full
complement by early Q2 and achieving optimal
productivity levels by the end of FY25.
We are also in the advanced stages of setting up
a fabric processing unit in Tamil Nadu, which will
enhance our vertical integration capabilities.
**LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS**
# Performance.
# Integration.

Dear Shareholders,
IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE
ANNUAL REPORT OF GOKALDAS EXPORTS
LIMITED FOR FY24. AS WE REFLECT ON THE
PAST YEAR, I AM PROUD OF OUR TEAM’S
RESILIENCE, ADAPTABILITY, AND UNWAVERING
COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE IN NAVIGATING A
CHALLENGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WHILE
LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE GROWTH.
**NAVIGATING GLOBAL HEADWINDS**
The global apparel industry faced significant
headwinds in FY24, with major markets
experiencing reduced demand due to inventory
destocking. The retail industry continued to grapple
with excess inventory for most of the year, resulting
in a 20% reduction in apparel purchases from the
US, a 19% decline from the EU, and a 28% drop
from the UK. Despite these challenges, I am pleased
to report that Gokaldas Exports demonstrated
remarkable resilience and adaptability.
Our consolidated revenue from operations grew
by 7.0% to I 2,378.9 crores in FY24, compared to
I 2,222.2 crores in the previous year.

**DRIVING GOVERNANCE**
**EXCELLENCE**
We believe that strong corporate governance
is fundamental to building trust with our
stakeholders and ensuring long-term success.
Our Board of Directors continues to provide
valuable guidance and oversight, ensuring that
we maintain the highest standards of ethical
conduct and transparency in all our operations.
In FY24, we further strengthened our
governance framework by implementing
enhanced risk management practices and
conducting regular audits of our sustainability
initiatives. We also expanded our stakeholder
engagement efforts, seeking feedback from
employees, customers, and local communities
to inform our decision-making processes.
**CHARTING THE COURSE AHEAD**
As we move forward, I am optimistic about
our future. The inventory destocking cycle in
major markets is nearing its end, with many
fashion brands showing reduced inventory
levels, improved financial performance, and
a renewed appetite for purchases. We expect
this trend to translate into stronger demand
for our products in the coming quarters.
Our focus remains on driving operational
excellence, realising synergies from our
acquisitions, and capitalising on growth
opportunities. We are committed to enhancing
shareholder value through sustainable growth,
margin improvement, and prudent capital
allocation.
Trial production is expected to commence in
Q4FY24 or early Q1FY25, further strengthening
our position in the value chain.
**EMBRACING OPPORTUNITIES AND**
**STRENGTHENING COMPETITIVENESS**
As we look ahead, we see significant opportunities
for growth. The ongoing shift of global sourcing
away from China, coupled with supplier
consolidation towards efficient and well-capitalised
players, positions Gokaldas Exports favourably.
We are witnessing strong demand traction,
particularly from our existing customer base, and
are well-positioned to capitalise on this trend.
To prepare for the next phase of growth, we
have strengthened our management by adding
talent at multiple levels. We are also focusing on
leveraging the strengths of our newly acquired
entities, including their unique product capabilities,
low-cost manufacturing locations, and diverse
customer relationships.
The potential implementation of Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs) with key markets like the
UK and EU presents exciting opportunities for
increased textile trade. Additionally, government
initiatives such as the Production Linked Incentive
(PLI) scheme for the Man-Made Fibre (MMF) and
technical textile ecosystem are expected to boost
investments in the sector.
**WEAVING SUSTAINABILITY INTO**
**OUR FABRIC**
At Gokaldas Exports, we recognise that
sustainable business practices are not just a
responsibility but a competitive advantage.
We have set ambitious goals to achieve net zero
emissions, water positivity, and zero solid waste in
landfills. Our efforts include implementing energy-
efficient systems, reducing water consumption,
and minimising waste generation across our
manufacturing units. We are proud to report that
our sustainability initiatives have yielded significant
results. We have achieved a 20% decrease in
water usage across our facilities. Additionally,
we have implemented a comprehensive waste
management system that has resulted in 80% of
our waste being recycled or repurposed.
Moreover, we take pride in our role as a
significant employer, particularly of women, in the
communities where we operate. Our workforce
of about 51,000 people, with a large proportion
being women, contributes significantly to social
upliftment and economic development in these
regions. We are committed to creating equitable
employment opportunities and fostering a diverse
and inclusive work environment.
For FY25, we anticipate continued growth in our
core business, aiming for a minimum of 15%
year-on-year increase. Furthermore, we expect
the acquired businesses to contribute significantly
to our consolidated performance. Our goal is to
improve the EBITDA margins of these acquired
entities to 10.5-11% in the medium term, with
a long-term aim of bringing them closer to
Gokaldas Exports’ standalone margins.
We also remain open to further expansion
opportunities, both organic and inorganic, as
we seek to strengthen our position in the global
apparel manufacturing industry. Our strong
balance sheet and cash position provide us with
the flexibility to pursue strategic investments that
align with our growth objectives.
In conclusion, I would like to express my heartfelt
gratitude to our employees, customers, suppliers,
and shareholders for their unwavering support.
Your trust and confidence in Gokaldas Exports
continue to be our greatest strength as we
navigate challenges and seize opportunities in our
journey towards becoming a global leader in the
apparel manufacturing industry.
As we look to the future, we remain committed
to our vision of sustainable growth, operational
excellence, and value creation for all our
stakeholders. Together, we will continue to weave
resilience, expand our horizons, and embrace
sustainable growth in the years to come.

# Management
# Discussion and Analysis
**GLOBAL ECONOMIC OVERVIEW**
The global economy demonstrated remarkable
resilience in 2023, navigating through various
challenges including geopolitical tensions, inflationary
pressures, and monetary tightening. According to
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth
was estimated at 3.2% in 2023 and is projected to
continue at the same pace in 2024 and 2025. This
resilience was underpinned by robust labour markets,
strong consumer spending, and the easing of supply
chain disruptions. Looking ahead, the IMF projects
that global growth will remain steady at 3.2% in
2024 before rising to 3.3% in 2025. The anticipated
improvement is expected to be driven by disinflation,
potential monetary easing in advanced economies,
and the ongoing economic rebalancing in China.
**GLOBAL APPAREL INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**
The global apparel industry faced significant headwinds
in 2023, with major markets experiencing reduced
demand due to inventory destocking. According to
industry reports, apparel purchases declined by 20%
in the US, 19% in the EU, and 28% in the UK on a
financial year basis compared to the previous year.
This inventory overhang was a result of supply chain
disruptions and changing consumer patterns in the
post-pandemic era.
The global textile and apparel trade remains a
substantial component of international commerce.
In 2022, the total global textile and apparel trade
reached $910 billion, with apparel trade accounting for
$540 billion. Going forward, the growth is expected
to be driven by the ongoing recovery in consumer
spending, the rise of e-commerce, and the increasing
focus on sustainable and ethical fashion.
The outlook for the global apparel industry is
cautiously optimistic. As we move into 2024 and
beyond, the industry is poised for recovery and
transformation. The inventory destocking cycle is
nearing its end, with many fashion brands showing
reduced inventory levels, improved financial
performance, and a renewed appetite for purchases.
This is expected to translate into stronger demand
for apparel manufacturers in the coming quarters.
However, challenges remain, including ongoing
geopolitical tensions, potential economic slowdowns
in key markets, and the need for significant
investments in sustainability and digitalisation.

**MD&A (CONTD.)**
**KEY TRENDS SHAPING THE GLOBAL APPAREL INDUSTRY**
Several key trends are shaping the global apparel
industry, influencing both the current landscape and
future outlook:
**1.	Sustainability and Ethical Fashion**

Consumers, particularly in developed markets, are
increasingly demanding environmentally responsible
and ethically produced garments. This shift is
compelling brands to reassess their supply chains
and partner with manufacturers who can meet these
evolving standards. Circular economy principles,
upcycling, and innovative sustainable materials are
gaining traction. Slow fashion, which emphasises
quality and longevity over fast-changing trends, is also
on the rise.
**2.	Digitalisation and E-commerce**

The pandemic accelerated the adoption of digital
technologies across the value chain, from design and
production to retail. E-commerce continues to grow,
with online apparel sales expected to contribute
a major share of overall apparel sales. The use of
Generative AI for personalization and efficiency
improvements is becoming more prevalent.
**3.	Shift in Global Sourcing**

The industry continues to witness a shift away
from China as the primary sourcing hub, driven by
rising labour costs, geopolitical tensions, and trade
issues. This ‘China Plus One’ strategy is creating
opportunities for countries like India, Bangladesh, and
Vietnam to expand their market share.
**4.	Consumer Behaviour Shifts**

Increased demand for sportswear and childrenswear,
driven by a focus on wellness and changing
sociodemographic factors, is reshaping product
portfolios. The rise of the ‘athleisure’ trend continues to
blur the lines between casual and athletic wear.
**5.	Technology Adoption**

Advanced technologies such as AI, robotics, and
virtual try-on tools are being increasingly adopted to
enhance efficiency and improve customer experience.
These technologies are revolutionising various aspects
of the industry, from design and production to
marketing and sales.
**6.	Fast Fashion and Quick Response**

Brands are increasingly focusing on reducing lead
times and improving their ability to respond quickly
to changing consumer preferences. This trend favours
manufacturers with strong local fabric ecosystems and
efficient production capabilities.
**7.	Customisation and Personalisation**

Advancements in technology are enabling greater
product customisation, allowing brands to offer
personalised products at scale. This trend is driven by
consumer demand for unique and tailored experiences.
**8.**
**Supply Chain Resilience**


In response to recent disruptions, companies are focusing on building
more resilient and flexible supply chains. This includes diversifying sourcing
locations, investing in nearshoring capabilities, and improving supply chain
visibility through digital technologies.
**9.**
**Inclusivity and Diversity**


There’s a growing emphasis on inclusivity in fashion, with more brands
expanding their size ranges and offering gender-neutral Design options.
This trend reflects broader societal shifts towards greater diversity and
representation.
**10.**
**Emerging new low-cost apparel manufacturing hubs**


The key factor cost i.e. cost of labour for China and Vietnam has increased
significantly in recent past compared to the other manufacturing locations like
South Asia, Africa and Latin America. India has lower labour costs than China
& Vietnam, but higher than Bangladesh. Kenya and Ethiopia have low labor
costs and an abundant labour pool with low to medium skills. The region
has a high fabric sourcing lead time due to the absence of the ecosystem.
The cost of electricity is not a major factor as this industry is not power
intensive. Kenya has duty free access to US under AGOA. In addition, it has
duty-free access to EU & UK under Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) &
Generalized Scheme of Preference (GSP) with EU & UK. Ethiopia has duty free
access to Japan, EU, UK, and Canada because of the Least Developed country
Status. It was also under AGOA but was excluded in 2022 and might be
included back.

**INDIAN ECONOMIC OVERVIEW**
India’s economy demonstrated robust resilience in 2023,
emerging as one of the fastest-growing major economies
globally. According to the Ministry of Statistics and
Programme Implementation (MoSPI), India’s GDP growth
rate for the fiscal year 2023-24 was approximately 7.2%,
driven by strong domestic demand, increased public
investment, and a rebound in the manufacturing and
services sectors. This growth was supported by various
government initiatives, including the Production Linked
Incentive (PLI) schemes and significant infrastructure
investments under the National Infrastructure Pipeline.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained a cautious
monetary policy stance throughout the year, balancing
inflation control with growth support. Inflation remained
within the target range, averaging around 5.5% for the
year, aided by stable food prices and effective monetary
interventions.
Looking ahead, the Indian economy is projected to grow
at a steady pace. The International Monetary Fund (IMF)
forecasts a GDP growth rate of 6.3% for 2024-25, driven
by continued structural reforms, digitalisation, and a
young, expanding workforce. Key factors contributing to
this positive outlook include:
**OUTLOOK FOR THE INDIAN APPAREL INDUSTRY**
The long-term outlook for the Indian apparel industry
remains positive, with several factors expected to drive
growth:
**1.	Shift in Global Sourcing**

The ongoing trend of diversifying supply chains
away from China presents a significant opportunity
for Indian manufacturers. Many global brands are
looking to increase their sourcing from India as part
of their “China Plus One” strategy.
**2.	Government Initiatives**

Programs like the PLI scheme for textiles and the
proposed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with key
markets like the UK and EU are expected to boost
the sector’s competitiveness.
**3.	Sustainability Focus**

The industry’s increasing emphasis on sustainable
and ethical manufacturing practices aligns with
global consumer trends, potentially opening up new
market opportunities.
**4.	Technological Advancements**

Adoption of digital technologies and automation
in manufacturing processes is expected to enhance
productivity and quality, making Indian apparel
more competitive globally.
According to the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF),
India’s textile and apparel exports could reach $100
billion by 2030, up from $44.4 billion in FY22. This
growth is expected to be driven by increased demand
from traditional markets like the US and EU, as well as
emerging markets in Asia and Africa.
**COMPANY OVERVIEW**
Gokaldas Exports Limited, established in 1979, has
emerged as one of India’s largest and most respected
apparel manufacturers and exporters. With over
four decades of experience, the company has built
a formidable reputation for delivering high-quality
apparel products to prestigious fashion brands and
retailers across more than 50 countries. Gokaldas
Exports is renowned for its robust in-house capabilities,
state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, and a strong
commitment to sustainability.
The Company operates over 30 state-of-the-art
manufacturing facilities equipped with advanced

The company employs over 51,000 people, with a
significant proportion being women. This focus on
inclusivity and empowerment is a cornerstone of
the company’s operations and contributes to social
upliftment in the communities where it operates.
**COMPANY’S PRODUCT OVERVIEW**
**OUTLOOK**
As we move into 2024 and beyond, the global
apparel industry is poised for recovery and
transformation. The inventory destocking cycle
is nearing its end, with many fashion brands
showing reduced inventory levels, improved
financial performance, and a renewed appetite
for purchases. This is expected to translate into
stronger demand for apparel manufacturers in
the coming quarters.
The potential implementation of Free Trade
Agreements (FTAs) with key markets like the
UK and EU presents exciting prospects for
increased textile trade from countries like India.
Additionally, government initiatives such as the
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the
Man-Made Fibre (MMF) and technical textile
ecosystem are expected to boost investments in
the sector.
**INDIAN APPAREL INDUSTRY**
**PERFORMANCE**
The Indian apparel industry, a significant contributor
to the country’s economy and employment, faced a
challenging year in 2023. According to the Apparel
Export Promotion Council (AEPC), India’s apparel
exports declined by about 10% in FY24 compared
to the previous year, primarily due to weak global
demand and increased competition from other low-cost
manufacturing countries. Despite these challenges, the
domestic apparel market showed resilience, supported
by rising disposable incomes and a growing middle class.
**Infrastructure Development**
Ongoing investments in infrastructure projects are
expected to enhance productivity and stimulate
economic activity.
**Digital Transformation**
Increased digital adoption across sectors is likely to
drive efficiency and innovation.
**Policy Support**
Continued government support through various
schemes and reforms aimed at improving the ease of
doing business and attracting foreign investment.

compliance with the requirements of the Companies
Act, 2013, and in conformity with the Indian Accounting
Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under section 133 of the
Act, read with Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)
Amendment Rules 2016, as amended and other
accounting principles generally accepted in India.
**ANALYSIS OF THE PROFIT AND LOSS**
**STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**Revenues**
The Company’s total income was I 2,408.99 crore in FY
2023-24 compared to I 2,247.23 crore in FY 2022-23.

2022-23. The company continued to deliver performance,
despite adverse macro-economic conditions in the year.
For most part of FY24, the retail industry continued to
be in an inventory overstock position resulting in brands
reducing their apparel purchases by 20% in the US, 19%
in the EU, and 28% in the UK. The inventory destocking
cycle in now coming to an end, with many fashion
brands showing reduced inventory, improved financial
performance and a renewed appetite to buy. In such a
challenging environment, your company’s like-for-like
revenue dropped by 2.3% y-o-y, compared to a 10%
drop in Indian exports in the same period, indicating the
resilience of the company in the face of adversity.
**Expenses**
Total expenses (excluding interest and depreciation) of
the Company increased by 8.89% to I 2,124.88 crore in
FY 2023-24 from I 1,951.42 crore in FY 2022-23. The
material consumption to the revenue from operations has
decreased to 47.7% in FY 2023-24 from 53.0% in FY
2022-23 due to better utilization of materials and lower
consumption due to change in product mix. Employees
expenses increased by 25.56% to I 777.59 crore in FY
2023-24 from I 619.32 crore in FY2022-23 due to revision
in the minimum wage for workmen in Karnataka, ramping
up employees in anticipation of volume growth in our
newly commissioned factory in Madya Pradesh, mainly
towards the second half of the year, besides employee
costs of the two acquisitions during Q4 FY24 of the year.
Also, the Company’s EBITDA decreased by 1.4% to 11.8%
in FY 2023-24 from 13.2% in the FY 2022-23. The drop in
margin was on account of certain one-off costs of I 17.4
crore that the company has incurred during the year such
as acquisition related costs, initial start-up costs in Madya
Pradesh unit. Adjusting the one-off costs, the company
has generated adjusted EBITDA of I 301.5 crore. Due to
the above factors, the company has made a net profit
after tax of I 130.97 crore during the year witnessing a
decline of about 24.28% compared to I 172.97 crore
in FY 2022-23.
**ANALYSIS OF THE BALANCE SHEET**
**Sources of funds**
The net worth of the Company has increased by
I 405.09 crore (45.71%) to I 1,291.34 crore as of
March 31, 2024 from I 886.25 crore as of March 31,
2023, mainly due to preferential allotment of equity
shares of I 247.5 crore to acquire the shares of Matrix
Design and Industries Private Limited, the newly
acquired wholly owned subsidiary and besides, profit
from the current year’s operations.
During the year under review the Company has also
taken USD 30 million as a term loan to partially fund
the acquisition of Atraco Industrial Enterprise and its
sister concerns (collectively called Atraco Group) for
USD 55 million. After acquisition of the two companies
through a combination of debt and equity, the
Company has a net debt of I 336.3 crore as of March
31, 2024, compared to a net cash of I 332.5 crore as of
March 31, 2023. However, subsequently, the Company
raised equity capital of I 600 crore through Qualified
Institutional Placement (QIP) in April 2024, which has
helped the Company to turn net cash positive.
Finance costs of the Company increased by 41.30%
to I 36.34 crore in FY 2023-24 from I 25.72 crore
in FY 2022-23 due to increase borrowing position
attributed to the acquisition of the two companies. As
a standalone operation, the company’s finance cost has
not increased. The Company’s interest cover decreased
to 5.38x in FY 2023-24 from 8.71x in FY 2022-23.
**Applications of funds**
Fixed assets (gross) of the Company increased by
1. 107.93% to I 600.88 crore as of March 31, 2024
from I 288.98 crore as of March 31, 2023, owing to
acquisition of Atraco and Matrix, besides, during the
year the company has spent investment of I 143 crore
towards modernization and upgradation of existing
machines, capacity creation, and also in the new
projects. These investments are expected to increase
revenue and yield operational productivity in the
future. Depreciation on fixed assets (excluding right of
use assets) increased by 34.16% to I 51.05 crore in FY
2023-24 from I 38.05 crore in FY 2022-23, owing to
an increase in fixed assets during the year.
One a like for like comparison, the capital employed of
the Company has increased by 10.69% to I 1,042.30
crore as of March 31, 2024, from I 941.61 crore as of
March 31, 2023. While the increase was mainly on
account of acquisition of Atraco and Matrix business,
the company incurred capital expenditure of I 143
crore towards modernisation and upgradation of
technology, plant and machineries at factories and
investment towards setting up of new manufacturing
units in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh and Perundurai,
Tamil Nadu. The capital employed comprises of two
key components that are non-current assets and
working capital investment while it does not include
certain components like the mutual fund investments,
lease assets and liabilities, and borrowings of the
Company. The return on capital employed (ROCE),
a measurement of returns derived from every rupee
invested in the business, on a like for like note, has
decreased by 500 basis points to 22% in FY 2023-24
from 27% in FY 2022-23. The reduction in the RoCE
was on account of investment in creating additional
capacity as well as in the new fabric processing unit
in Tamil Nadu, and further, profit impacted due to the
lower volume and  start up expenses in the MP unit.
**Working capital management**
Current assets of the Company increased by 57.61%
to I 1,386.60 crore as of March 31, 2024, from
I 879.79 crore as of March 31, 2023. The current asset

**MD&A (CONTD.)**
**OUTLOOK**
As Gokaldas Exports looks ahead, it is well-positioned to capitalise on emerging opportunities in
the global apparel market. The company’s strategic initiatives, robust manufacturing capabilities,
and commitment to sustainability provide a strong foundation for future growth. The ongoing
trend of diversifying supply chains away from China presents significant opportunities for
Indian manufacturers, and Gokaldas Exports, with its strong manufacturing base and strategic
acquisitions, is well-positioned to capture a larger share of the global apparel market.
The company remains focused on driving operational excellence, realising synergies from its
acquisitions, and capitalising on growth opportunities. With its expanded capabilities, global
presence, and commitment to innovation and sustainability, Gokaldas Exports is poised to
strengthen its position as a leader in the global apparel manufacturing industry.
**RISK MANAGEMENT**
At Gokaldas Exports Limited, we recognize that effective risk management is crucial for sustainable
growth and long-term value creation. Our comprehensive risk management framework enables us
to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that could impact our business operations.
**HUMAN RESOURCES AND**
**INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS**
At Gokaldas Exports Limited, our workforce remains the
cornerstone of our success. As of March 31, 2024, our
team has grown to over 51,000 dedicated employees,
reflecting our continued expansion and the integration
of our recent acquisitions. This diverse talent pool, with
its rich blend of expertise and cross-sectoral experience,
continues to be our primary competitive advantage in
the dynamic apparel manufacturing industry.
In FY24, we focused on fostering an inclusive and
empowering work environment that encourages
innovation and personal growth. Our organisational
structure has evolved to promote agility and cross-
functional collaboration, moving away from traditional
hierarchies. We’ve implemented several initiatives
to enhance employee engagement and well-being,
including:
-  Comprehensive skill development programs
-  Leadership training for mid-level managers
-  Enhanced health and safety measures across
all facilities
-  Improved work-life balance initiatives
We’re particularly proud of our efforts to promote
gender diversity, with women now comprising
approximately 75% of our workforce. This aligns with
our commitment to social upliftment in the communities
where we operate.
The integration of employees from our newly acquired
entities - Atraco and Matrix Design - has been a key
focus area. We are committed to implement cultural
integration programs and standardised HR practices
to ensure a smooth transition and create a unified
Gokaldas Exports culture.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to nurturing our
human capital, recognizing it as the driving force behind
our continued growth and success in the global apparel
market.
**INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND**
**THEIR EFFECTIVENESS**
In FY24, Gokaldas Exports Limited further strengthened
its internal control systems to support our expanded
operations and ensure robust financial reporting and
operational efficiency. Key developments include:

Planning (ERP) system across all entities, including
our recent acquisitions, to streamline processes and
enhance data integrity.
-  Appointment of a new internal auditor with expertise
in the apparel manufacturing sector to provide fresh
perspectives on our control mechanisms.
-  Expansion of the internal audit scope to cover our
newly acquired entities, ensuring consistent control
standards across the group.
-  Enhanced risk management framework to address
the evolving challenges in the global apparel industry.
Our internal audit process continues to be rigorous, with
quarterly audits conducted across key business areas.
The audit committee, composed entirely of independent
directors, reviews these findings and the management’s
responses, ensuring transparency and accountability.
In light of our recent acquisitions, we’ve placed
particular emphasis on harmonising internal control
practices across all entities. This process, while ongoing,
has already yielded improvements in operational
efficiency and risk mitigation.
The Board remains actively involved in overseeing the
effectiveness of our internal control systems, regularly
reviewing audit committee minutes and providing
guidance on strengthening our control environment.

**COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE**
In 2024, your Company demonstrated remarkable resilience
achieving better financial performance, revenue growth, and
consistent profit despite passing through a difficult year. Your
Company remained confident in its growth strategy and the
long-term opportunities, and this success is a testament to
the unwavering commitment of our senior leadership team
and the dedicated workforce who propelled us to new heights
despite the challenging global market environment.
The year started with a slow offtake in global retail resulting in
overall imports from major consuming markets like the US, UK,
and EU declining significantly in Q1 and Q2 of FY24, owing
to inventory overhang with customers. Weak retail demand in
Autumn-Winter 2022, inflationary trends, high interest rates,
and a mild winter, contributed to excess inventory, impacting
offtake. Major brands were consciously liquidating excess
inventory holdings and controlling their purchases.
For most of FY24, the retail industry continued to be in an
inventory overstock position resulting in brands reducing their
apparel purchases by 20% in the US, 19% in the EU, and
28% in the UK. The inventory destocking cycle came to an
end in Q4 FY24 with many fashion brands showing reduced
inventory, improved financial performance and a renewed
appetite to buy. In such a challenging environment, your
Company’s like-for-like revenue from operations dropped by
1. 2.3% y-o-y, compared to a 10% drop in Indian exports in the
same period, indicating the resilience of the Company in the
face of adversity. Sensing an opportunity to further consolidate
its position in the apparel industry, your Company completed
the acquisition of Atraco and Matrix, enabling the addition of
new product offerings such as high-value knitwear and access
to low-cost locations like Kenya and Ethiopia, along with clear
access to mutually exclusive new customers.
In FY24, the consolidated revenue of the Company grew by
1. 7.2% and we added incremental revenue from operations
of ` 156.69 Crore. The Company continued to deliver
performance, despite adverse macro-economic conditions in
the year.
On the cost front, the Company faced several headwinds,
including an increase in statutory minimum wages, ramping
up employees in anticipation of volume growth in the
second half of the year, startup costs at our new unit, and
one-off expenses related to the two acquisitions. This has
suppressed the operating margin by 1.4% from 13.2%
in the year 2022-23 to 11.8% in the current year. It has
delivered a profit before tax of ` 159 Crore compared to
` 198 Crore (excluding one-off income of ` 6 Crore) in the
year 2022-23. Your Company generated cash from operation
without working capital changes of about ` 266 Crore during
the year securing a healthy financial base for the Company.
During the year, your Company has made capital investment
of ` 143 Crores towards the modernization and upgradation
of existing machines, capacity creation, and new projects.
These investments are expected to increase revenue and yield
operational productivity in the future. Further, your company
completed the acquisition of Atraco entities at an investment
of ` 373 Crores by deploying funds through a combination
of debt and own funds. Your company has further deployed
funds to complete acquisition of Matrix Design with an
investment of ` 323 Crores through a combination of
preferential allotment of equity shares and cash.
Our new manufacturing unit in Madhya Pradesh is progressing
well, and we expect production to increase in the coming
quarters. The fabric processing unit in Tamil Nadu is all set to
commence commercial production.

Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
After the acquisition of the two companies through a
combination of debt and equity, the Company had a net
debt of ` 336 Crore as of March 31, 2024. Subsequently,
the Company raised equity capital of ` 600 Crore through
Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP) in April 2024, which
has helped the Company to turn net cash positive.
To prepare for the next phase of growth, the Company has
added talent to its management bandwidth and at multiple
levels. The long-term prospects for the industry remain intact
with a continuing shift of global sourcing away from China,
supplier consolidation towards efficient and well-capitalized
players, and supply-side instabilities in several countries.
Favourable currency, PLI, and FTAs with key markets should
drive the Company toward a strong future.
Your Company’s long-term strategic objective is to create
value for its shareholders, employees, and business partners
by delivering quality products, and excellence in customer
relationships, and will continue to remain focused on these
initiatives for sustainable profitable growth.
**BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT**
The US, EU, and China markets dominate the global retail
clothing sales landscape with a combined share of 45%, with
the US commanding a dominant share of 16%, followed by
the EU and China at 15% and 14%, respectively. During 2023,
retail clothing sales in these key geographies remained buoyant
despite the high interest rates raised in pursuit of controlling
inflation. Retail brands with high inventory carryover from the
previous year declined their purchases, thereby importing less,
and have now reached optimum inventory levels. Apparel
imports by the US, EU, and UK in FY24 witnessed a Y-o-Y
decline of 20%, 19%, and 28%, respectively. However, India’s
apparel exports declined by only 10%, indicating a market
share gain. The Red Sea issue caused delays in shipments as
cargo shipments had to resort to longer alternative routes.
There is a trend towards increasing sourcing from India as
brands are consciously reducing their exposure to China due to
the high sourcing concentration from a single region coupled
with ongoing geopolitical tensions. Additionally, higher labour
costs in Vietnam and Bangladesh’s recent wage revision could
open up sourcing opportunities for India, which has a fully-
fledged cotton ecosystem. Increasing ESG consciousness
among consumers is pushing retail brands to adapt to
such needs by raising compliance requirements, leading to
consolidation within the industry as small manufacturers have
limited resources to meet such investments.
Domestically, the central government’s key policy initiatives,
such as the continuation of RoSTCL until 2026, ongoing
discussions to expand the products, and lowering the minimum
investment eligibility criteria being deliberated to trigger
investment via the PLI scheme and the Mega Integrated Textile
Region and Apparel (MITRA) initiative, will certainly augur well
in the long run. Various Indian state governments are also
giving a policy push to the textile and apparel sector through
attractive incentive schemes, leading to job creation among
locals. Additionally, the Indian government is actively pursuing
bilateral trade agreements with potential countries, which will
further boost the industry. The successful conclusion of FTAs
with the UAE and Australia and the last-stage discussions with
the UK indicate positive prospects.
**DIVIDEND**
No dividend has been recommended by the Directors for the
financial year 2023-24.
In terms of Regulation 43A of SEBI (Listing Obligations and
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“the Listing

Information as per Section 134(3)(m) of the Companies Act, 2013, read with the Rule 8(3) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules,
2014, and forming part of the Board’s Report for the financial year ended on March 31, 2024.
**CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE**
**EARNINGS AND OUTGO**
In pursuance of the Conservation of Energy, Technology
Absorption, Foreign Exchange Earnings in such manner as
prescribed under Rule 8 (3) of the Companies (Accounts)
Rules, 2014, the particulars of the same are given below:
**A. Conservation of energy**
The operations of the Company are not energy intensive.
However, the Company takes continuous initiatives to curtail
consumption of energy on an ongoing basis.
**(i) Steps taken or impact on conservation of energy**
a.
Installed G2 Ozone machines which utilize atmospheric
air to reproduce ozone gas conditions to give garments
a natural look. This technology significantly reduces
water and energy usage while eliminating the
need for polluting processes such as bleaching and
permanganate usage.
b.
Installed E-Flow machines which utilize nanobubbles of
air to transmit chemicals into garments with minimal
water and zero discharge. This innovative process
eliminates the need for large amounts of hot water
and steam typically required in wet processes, resulting
in significant energy savings. e-Flow can reduce energy
consumption by 15-25% compared to conventional
garment finishing methods.
c.
Pad printing machines that have been installed achieve
energy efficiency with eco-friendly tech and optimized
processes. Low-temperature curing inks reduce drying
energy, alongside machines featuring auto shut-
off and energy-saving modes. Process optimization
cuts energy waste by enhancing ink application and
drying times. These steps enhance sustainability in pad
printing operations.
d.
Installed new screen printing’s energy-efficient design
to minimize environmental impact in print operations.
Its precise ink application reduces overspray and waste,
enhancing energy savings. Automated systems and easy
maintenance streamline upkeep, boosting productivity
and ensuring high-quality, uninterrupted output while
optimizing energy use.
e.
Replaced 50% of reciprocating compressors with
high-efficiency screw air compressors. These new
compressors consume less energy and require minimal
maintenance, leading to improved efficiency and
reduced operational costs.
f.
Implemented machines that simplify tasks and reduce
dependence on excessive machinery. These machines
help minimize the need for specialized skills and
streamline operations.
g.
Upgraded old boilers, which had an efficiency of
55%, to a new high-efficiency model with 80%
efficiency, resulting in significant energy savings and
improved performance.
**(ii) Steps taken by the Company for utilizing**
**alternate sources of energy**
The Company has in place a rooftop solar system in one of its
units. In its pursuit to actively transition towards renewable
energy, aligning with its sustainability goals, the board of
the Company in October 2023 approved for Energy Supply
Agreement (ESA) with Clean Max Celeste Private Limited a
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), for developing a captive power
generation facility with 7.5 mw solar plant in the state of
Karnataka. In this regard, the Company has made an equity
investment of an amount up to ` 314.74 lakhs during the year
for the long-term consumption of renewable power.
**(iii) Capital investment on energy conservation**
**equipments**
•
During the FY 2023-24, the Company has invested
approximately ` 40.56 Crore on the energy conservation
equipments.
**B. Technology absorption, adaptations and**
**innovation**
**(i) Efforts made towards technology absorption**
a.
The Company has adopted advanced technologies to
enhance sustainability across its operations: Installed
G2 Ozone and E-Flow machines utilize atmospheric air
and nanobubbles to minimize water, energy usage, and
eliminate polluting processes. Pad printing and screen-
printing machines optimize energy efficiency with low-
temperature curing inks, automatic shut-off features,
and streamlined processes that reduce waste and
enhance productivity.
b.
In line with the previous years, the Company has
continued
to
implement
an
automated
hanger
system to boost line efficiency, cut handling time, and
optimize needle time. This automated setup streamlines
operations, enhancing productivity while minimizing
operational delays.

1. 1.
Climate Change
and Biodiversity
Risk
Prioritizing climate change and biodiversity
in the garment manufacturing industry is
essential for environmental sustainability,
regulatory compliance, consumer trust,
risk management, and fostering positive
community relationships. The apparel
industry is a significant contributor to
greenhouse gas emissions, primarily
through energy-intensive production
processes and extensive use of synthetic
materials. By adopting sustainable practices
such as energy efficiency, renewable energy
sources, and reducing emissions, companies
can help combat global warming and

Human Capital
Development
Opportunity
Human capital development is critical in
labor-intensive manufacturing industries,
especially where the majority of the
workforce is women. Investing in the
education, skills, and well-being of
employees not only enhances productivity
but also fosters a more equitable and
sustainable workplace. When workers feel
valued and see opportunities for growth,
they are more likely to be motivated and
committed to their jobs. This is particularly
important in labor-intensive industries
where the work can be repetitive and
demanding. Focusing on the development
of female employees can address gender
disparities and promote inclusivity.
1. 1.	 Investing in creating
livelihood opportunities
for under-privileged and
marginalized communities
1. 2.	 Increasing our efforts in
providing safe, secure and
inclusive work environment for
our workers and employees

employee well-being and
capacity building opportunities
1. 4.	 Collaborating with external
agencies to impart training
and skill to communities
with an objective of
enhancing employability

to advance within the industry. Providing
workers with continuous training in new
technologies, processes, and best practices
can significantly improve the quality and
productivity. A supportive environment
that promotes professional development
can reduce turnover rates and attract
new talent. Effective talent management
strategies, such as career development
programs, mentorship, and leadership
training, can create pathways for employees
to advance within the Company.
1. 1.	 Implementing wide range of
skill development programs for
workers and employees
1. 2.	 Incorporating dedicated
soft skills and technical skills
upliftment for women workers
and employees
1. 3.	 Developing and implementing
career progression roadmaps for
workers and employees
1. 4.	 Engaging with workers and
employees in addressing
attrition and abseentism
1. 5.	 Implementing programs

management. It is critical to ensure that
ethical labor practices, safe working
conditions, and quality assurance measures
are followed by supply chain partners. By
adopting responsible sourcing, garment
manufacturers can ensure compliance with
regulations, and avoid potential disruptions
to their supply chain.
1. 1.	 Started mapping of suppliers
and dialogue on issues
related to environmental and
social performance
1. 2.	 Developing guidelines on
responsible sourcing and supply
chain management
1. 3.	 Initiating traceability and
transparency programs across
value chain
Negative
1. 8.
Community
Engagement
Opportunity
Community engagement fosters trust,
provides valuable local insights, creates
beneficial partnerships, and strengthens
the social license to operate, ultimately
contributing to sustainable and responsible
business practices. By demonstrating a
commitment to social responsibility and
ethical practices, industry can gain the
support of local stakeholders, navigating
regulatory landscapes and ensuring smooth
operations across different locations.
Understanding the unique social, cultural,
and economic dynamics of each community
allows businesses to tailor community
development initiatives to better align with
local values and expectations. This can
enhance the effectiveness of corporate
social responsibility (CSR) programs
and improve the overall impact of the
Company's efforts.
1. 1. 	 Engaging with local
communities through CSR
initiatives like:
•
Enhancing health
care facilities
•
Improving infrastructure of
education institutions
•
Setting up skill
development centers
•

1. 9.
Grievance
Redressal
Opportunity
Implementing a robust grievance redressal
mechanism in a garment manufacturing
industry is essential for ensuring a safe,
fair, and productive work environment.
Such mechanisms ensure that workers and
employees have a clear and accessible way
to voice their concerns and complaints.
This is particularly important for female
workers who may face unique challenges
such as gender discrimination, harassment,
or unequal treatment. Providing a safe
and confidential platform for reporting
issues helps in addressing and resolving
these problems promptly. Appropriate
grievance redressal system promotes a
culture of respect and trust. When workers
and employees know that their concerns
would be taken seriously and addressed
appropriately, it builds confidence in the
management and encourages a more
open and communicative workplace. By
proactively resolving complaints, companies
can retain their workforce, reduce
absenteeism, and maintain operational
efficiency.
1. 1.	 Reinforcing existing mechanisms
and incorporating technological
interventions for wider reach
1. 2.	 Continuously organizing variety
of awareness and sensitization
programs for workers
and employees
1. 3.	 Improving counselling
efforts with internal and
external experts
1. 4.	 Enhancing dedicated human
resources for grievance redressal
Positive
1. 10.
Health and Safety
Risk
The garment industry often involves various
tasks which can pose significant health and
safety risks. It is our prime responsibility
to provide a healthy and safe workplace
for all employees. The manufacturing
operations involve physically demanding
and repetitive tasks, exposure to chemicals,
and operating machinery. It is paramount
to implement and ensure strict health and
safety standards and provide appropriate
protective equipment to prevent accidents
and adverse health issues. When employees
feel safe and healthy, they are more likely to
be engaged and efficient in their work. This
is especially important in a labor-intensive
industry where the physical and mental
well-being of the workforce directly impacts
overall productivity and quality of output.
1. 1.	 Organizing training and
awareness on Health and Safety
for all workers and employees in
a periodic manner
1. 2.	 Holistically adopting Life and
Building Safety (LABS) standards
across our facilities
1. 3.	 Mimimising the Hazards
and Risks through continual
improvement action plans
1. 4.	 Rolling out reward and
recognition program covering
all employees

**AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE**

**STATEMENTS**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the standalone financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone
financial statements.

the audit trail feature was not enabled at the
database level to log any direct data changes.
The audit trail feature, which was enabled, as

course of our examination, we did not come
across any instance of audit trail feature being
tampered with, in respect of the accounting
software for the period for which the audit
trail was operating.

Based on our examination, the Company has
used a payroll software which is operated
by a third-party software service provider
for maintaining its books of account for the
year ended March 31, 2024. In the absence
of independent auditor’s report of the service
organization, we are unable to comment

at the database level as stated above,
in respect of which the audit trail facility
has not operated throughout the year for
all relevant transactions recorded in this
accounting software during the year ended
March 31, 2024.

Further, during the course of our examination,
we did not come across any instance of

respect of the accounting software for the
period for which the audit trail feature was

# Annexure A
To the independent auditor’s report on even date on the Standalone Financial Statements of **Gokaldas Exports Limited**
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the standalone financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal
control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i)
of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal
financial controls with reference to standalone financial
statements in place and the operating effectiveness of
such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management and
Board of Directors.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of management and
Board of Director’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If
we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the standalone financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However,
future events or conditions may cause the Company to
cease to continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the standalone financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the standalone financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
We communicate with those charged with governance
regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including
any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of most
significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements
for the year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore, the
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
we determine that a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so
would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest
benefits of such communication.

regard to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. Pursuant to the programme, a portion of Property,
plant and equipment and right of use assets have been physically verified by Management during the year. No material
discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
(c)
According to the information and explanations given to us, the title deeds of immovable properties (other than

the Company for holding benami property under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988, as amended and

Company.
ii.     (a)
The inventory (excluding stocks with third parties and stocks-in-transit) has been physically verified by the management
during the year. In respect of inventory lying with third parties, these have substantially been confirmed by them and in
respect of goods in transit, the goods have been received subsequent to the year end. In our opinion, the frequency,
coverage and procedure of such verification is reasonable and appropriate, having regard to the size of the Company
and the nature of its operations. The discrepancies noticed on physical verification of inventory as compared to book
records were not 10% or more in aggregate for each class of inventory.
(b)
During the year the Company has been sanctioned working capital limits in excess of ` 5 crores in aggregate from
Banks and/financial institutions on the basis of security of current assets. Based on the records examined by us in
the normal course of audit of the financial statements, quarterly returns/statements filed with such Banks/financial
institutions are in agreement with the books of accounts of the Company.

**INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL**
**FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE**
**TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS**
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls with reference to standalone financial statements,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
standalone financial statements to future periods are subject
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference
to standalone financial statements may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

both domestic and overseas.
**2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES**
The significant accounting policies applied by the Company
in the preparation of its standalone financial statements are
listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied
consistently to all the periods presented in these standalone
financial statements.
**2.1 Statement of Compliance with Ind AS**
In accordance with the notification issued by the Ministry
of Corporate Affairs, the Company has adopted Indian
Accounting Standards (referred to as ‘Ind AS’) notified under
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015
and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) amendment
Rules 2016, as amended with effect from April 01, 2016. The
standalone financial statements of the Company, have been
prepared and presented in accordance with Ind AS.
The standalone financial statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets
and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial
instruments) which are measured at fair value.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company
is Indian Rupee ( ` ) which is the currency of the primary
economic environment in which the Company operates. All
amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest lakhs, unless
otherwise indicated.
**2.2 Summary of material accounting policies**
**a. Current versus non-current classification**
The Company presents assets and liabilities in the standalone
balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An
asset is treated as current when it is:
•
Expected to be realized or intended to be sold or
consumed in normal operating cycle;
•
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
•
Expected to be realized within twelve months after the
reporting period; or
•
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve
months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
•
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
•
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
•
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the
reporting period; or
•
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement
of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.
The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current
assets and liabilities.
Advance tax paid is classified as non-current assets.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and
cash equivalents.
The Company has identified twelve months as its
operating cycle.
**b. Fair value measurement of financial instruments**
The Company measures financial instruments, such as,
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date using
valuation techniques.

# Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
**For the year ended March 31, 2024**
(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)
**130**
Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
>
In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
>
In the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be
accessible by the Company.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in
their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by
selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use.
The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate
in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of
relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured
or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole:
Level 1 - 	 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - 	 Valuation techniques for which the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 - 	 Valuation techniques for which the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the standalone
financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company
determines whether transfers have occurred between levels
in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on
the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
**c. Foreign currencies**
In preparing the standalone financial statements, transactions
in the currencies other than the Company’s functional currency
are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date
of transaction. At the end of each reporting period, monetary
items denominated in the foreign currencies are re-translated
at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. Non-
monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on
the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary
items are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign
currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation or settlement
of other monetary items are included in the statement of
profit and loss for the period.
**d. Revenue recognition**
**i. Revenue from Contracts with Customers**
Effective April 01, 2018, the Company adopted Ind AS
115 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the
cumulative catch-up transition method, applied to contracts
that were not completed as of April 01, 2018. In accordance
with the cumulative catch-up transition method, the
comparatives have not been retrospectively adjusted.
The following is a summary of new and/or revised significant
accounting policies related to revenue recognition.
*Performance obligations and timing of revenue*
*recognition:*
The Company derives its revenue primarily from export of
garments and related products, with revenue recognised at a
point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the
customer. This is generally when the goods are delivered to
the customer/agent nominated by the customer.
There is limited judgement needed in identifying the point
when control passes:
-
once physical delivery of the products has occurred to
the location as per agreement;
-
the Company no longer has physical possession;
-
usually will have a present right to payment (as a single
payment on delivery); and
-
retains none of the significant risks and rewards of the
goods in question.
The Company also derives some revenue from job work
contracts. In these cases, revenue is recognised as and when
services are rendered i.e. the products on which job work is
performed is delivered to the customer at agreed location.
*Determining the transaction price*
The Company's revenue is derived from fixed price contracts
and therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from each

contract is determined by reference to those fixed prices.
There is no significant variable consideration involved.
*Allocating amounts to performance obligations*
For most contracts, there is a fixed unit price for each unit
sold, therefore, there is no judgement involved in allocating
the contract price to each unit.
*Costs of fulfilling contracts*
The costs of fulfilling contracts do not result in the recognition
of a separate asset because such costs are included in the
carrying amount of inventory for contracts involving the sale
of goods.
The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its
Statement of Profit and loss.
Advances received from customers are in the nature of
contract liability.
**ii. Revenue from export incentives**
Export incentives are recognised on accrual basis in accordance
with the applicable schemes formulated, by the Government
of India and where there is reasonable assurance that the
enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to them.
**iii. Interest income**
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost
or at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘OCI’),
interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated
future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the
financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate,
to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the
amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the
effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the
financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit
losses. Interest income is included in finance income in the
statement of profit and loss.
**iv. Dividends**
Dividend income on investments is accounted when the right
to receive the dividend is established, which is generally when
shareholders approve the dividend.
**v. Others**
Insurance/other claims are recognized on acceptance basis.
**e. Non-current assets held for sale**
The Company classifies non-current assets as held for sale if
their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a
sale rather than through continuing use.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only
when the assets or disposal group is available for immediate
sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are
usual and customary for sales of such assets, its sale is highly
probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The
Company treats sale of the asset to be highly probable when:
a)
The appropriate level of management is committed to a
plan to sell the asset;
b)
An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the
plan has been initiated;
c)
The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price
that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value;
d)
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year from the date of
classification; and
e)
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is
unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made
or that the plan will be withdrawn.
**f. Government grants**
The Company recognizes government grants only when
there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to
them shall be complied with, and the grants will be received.
Government grants related to assets are treated as income in
the standalone statement of profit and loss upon fulfilment
of the conditions attached to the grant received. These grants
are presented in the standalone balance sheet by deducting
the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a
systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the
periods necessary to match them with the related costs which
they are intended to compensate.
Export incentives are recognized on accrual basis in accordance
with the applicable schemes formulated, by the Government
of India and where there is reasonable assurance that the
enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to them.
**g. Taxes**
**Current income tax**
Tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred
tax. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for
the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the statement of profit and loss because it excludes items of
income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable
or deductible. Current income tax assets and liabilities are
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or
paid to the taxation authorities. The Company’s liability for
current tax is calculated using the tax rates and tax laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.

# Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements
**For the year ended March 31, 2024**
(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)
**132**
Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
**Deferred income tax**
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable
on differences between the carrying values of assets and
liabilities in the standalone financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of the
taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet
liability model. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all the taxable temporary differences. In contrast, deferred
assets are only recognised to the extent that is probable that
future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible
temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset
to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other
comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either
in OCI or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (‘MAT’)
paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely
to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of
set off against future income tax liability. Accordingly, MAT is
recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when
the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that
the future economic benefit associated with the asset will
be realized.
**h. Property, plant and equipment (PPE) and**
**Intangible assets and Depreciation/amortization**
On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected to continue
with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and
equipment recognised as at March 31, 2016 measured as per
the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed
cost of the property, plant and equipment as on April 01,
1. 2016.
Freehold land is carried at historical cost and is not depreciated.
Capital work in progress and all other property, plant and
equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included
in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of any component accounted for as
separate assets are de-recognised when replaced. All other
repairs and maintenance are charged to profit and loss during
the reporting period in which they are incurred.
The Company identifies and determines cost of each
component/part of the asset separately, if the component/part
has a cost which is significant to the total cost of the asset
having useful life that is materially different from that of the
remaining asset. These components are depreciated over their
useful lives; the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of
the principal asset.
Depreciation is provided using the written down value
method as per the useful lives of the assets estimated by the
management with residual value upto 5%, which is equal to
the corresponding rates prescribed under schedule II of the
Companies Act, 2013.

The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant
part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or
when no future economic benefits are expected from its
use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition
of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is
included in the statement of profit and loss when the asset
is derecognized.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either
finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at
the end of each reporting period with the effect of any change
in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern
of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in
the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible
assets with finite lives is recognised in the standalone
statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms
part of carrying value of another asset.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible
asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are
recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the asset
is derecognised.

entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the
extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or
sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for the intended use
or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period
in which they occur.
**j. Leases**
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains)
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease
if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a
specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right
to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly
specified in an arrangement.
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or
an operating lease.
For arrangements entered into prior to April 01, 2016, the
Company has determined whether the arrangement contain
lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing on the
date of transition.
**Company as a lessee**
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards
incidental to ownership to the Company is classified as a
finance lease.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Company
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset
is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the asset and the lease term.
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the
lease at the inception date fair value of the leased asset or,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Lease payments
are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of
the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are
recognised in finance costs in the statement of profit and
loss unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets,
in which case they are capitalized in accordance with the
Company’s general policy on the borrowing costs.

Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases
for Buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract
contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or
contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the
right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company
assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an
identified asset; (ii) the Company has substantially all of the
economic benefits from use of the asset through the period
of the lease; and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the
use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company
recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee,
except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and
low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments
as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term
of the lease.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented
in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified
as financing cash flows.
**k. Inventories**
**Inventories are valued as follows:**
Raw materials, packing materials, stores, spares and
consumables are valued at lower of cost or net realisable
value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location
and condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average
basis. However, materials and other items held for use in the
production of inventories are not written down below cost if
the finished products in which they will be incorporated are
expected to be sold at or above cost.
Work-in-progress and finished goods are valued at lower
of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes cost of direct
materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing
overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but
excluding borrowing costs. Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis. These are valued at lower of cost and net
realisable value after considering provision for obsolescence
and other anticipated loss, wherever considered necessary.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
**l. Provisions and contingent liabilities**
**i. Provisions**
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be
reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the
reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset, but only
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense
relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit
and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of
time is recognized as a finance cost.
**ii. Contingent liabilities**
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain
future events beyond the control of the Company or a present
obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare
cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does
not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence
in the standalone financial statements.
Provisions and contingent liabilities are reviewed at each
balance sheet.
**m. Retirement and other employee benefits**
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund, employee
state insurance and pension fund are defined contribution
scheme. The Company has no obligation, other than the
contribution payable to the respective funds. The Company
recognises contribution payable to provident fund, pension
fund and employee state insurance as expenditure, when
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution
payable to the scheme for service received before the balance
sheet reporting date exceeds the contribution already paid, the
deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after
deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution
already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received
before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as
an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for
example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
All employee benefits payable/available within twelve months
of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee
benefits. Benefits such as salaries, allowances and bonus etc.,
are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period
in which the employee renders the related service.
Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation which is funded
through policy taken from Life Insurance Corporation of India
('LIC') and liability (net of fair value of investment in LIC) is

provided for on the basis of actuarial valuation on projected
unit credit method made at the end of each balance sheet
date. Every employee who has completed 4 years 240 days or
more of the service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days’
salary (last drawn salary) of each completed year of service.
The fair value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross
obligation under the defined benefit plans to recognise the
obligation on a net basis.
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within
the next twelve months, is treated as short-term employee
benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a
result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the
reporting date.
The Company treats accumulated leave expected to be carried
forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee
benefit
for
measurement
purposes.
Such
long-term
compensated absences are provided for based on the
actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method at
the year-end.
The Company presents the leave as a current liability in the
standalone balance sheet, to the extent it does not have an
unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months
after the reporting date.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses,
the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in
net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on
the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately
in the standalone balance sheet with a corresponding debit or
credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which
they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the
earlier of:
a.
The date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and
b.
The date that the Company recognises related restructuring
costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the
net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises
the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as
an expense in the statement of profit and loss:
a.
Service costs comprising current service costs, past-
service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-
routine settlements; and
b.
Net interest expense or income.
**n. Share-based payments**
Employees of the Company receive remuneration in
the form of share-based payments, whereby employees
render services as consideration for equity instruments
(equity-settled transactions).
**Equity-settled transactions**
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an
appropriate valuation model.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, over
the period in which the service/performance conditions are
fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense
recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the
vesting period has expired and the Company’s best estimate
of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The statement of standalone profit and loss expense or credit
for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is
recognised in employee benefits expense.
Service and non-market performance conditions are not
taken into account when determining the grant date fair
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being
met is assessed as part of the Company’s best estimate of the
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market
performance conditions are reflected within the grant date
fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but
without an associated service requirement, are considered
to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are
reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate
expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or
performance conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest
because non-market performance and/or service conditions
have not been met. Where awards include a market or
non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested
irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is
satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service
conditions are satisfied.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified,
the minimum expense recognised is the expense had the
terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the
award are met. An additional expense is recognised for
any modification that increases the total fair value of the
share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to
the employee as measured at the date of modification. Where
an award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any
remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed
immediately through profit or loss.

_Gokaldas Exports Limited
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted
earnings per share (except for anti-dilution).
**o. Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when
the Company becomes a party to the contract embodying
the related financial instruments. All financial assets, financial
liabilities and financial guarantee contracts are initially
measured at transaction cost and where such values are
different from the fair value, at fair value. Transaction costs
that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of
financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial
assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and
loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured
on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through
profit and loss are immediately recognised in the statement
of profit and loss. In case of interest free or concession loans/
debentures/preference shares given to subsidiaries, the excess
of the actual amount of the loan over initial measure at fair
value is accounted as an equity investment.
Investment in equity instruments issued by subsidiaries,
associates and joint ventures are measured at cost
less impairment.
**Effective interest method**
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating
interest income or expense over the relevant period. The
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future
cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the
financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.
**(a) Financial assets**
*Financial assets at amortised cost*
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if
these financial assets are held within a business model whose
objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual
cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
*Financial assets measured at fair value*
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within
a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in
order to collect contractual cash flows or to sell these financial
assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset not measured at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income is carried at fair value
through the statement of profit and loss.
For financial assets maturing within one year from the balance
sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments.
*Impairment of financial assets excluding investments*
*in subsidiary*
Loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised for
financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value
through other comprehensive income.
The Company recognises impairment loss on trade receivables
using expected credit loss model, which involves use of
provision matrix constructed on the basis of historical credit
loss experience as permitted under Ind AS 109 – Impairment
loss on investments.
For financial assets whose credit risk has not significantly
increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to
twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss
allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is
recognised if the credit risk on the financial instruments has
significantly increased since initial recognition.
*De-recognition of financial assets*
The Company de-recognises a financial asset only when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer
qualifies for de-recognition under Ind AS 109.
If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all
the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control
the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained
interest in the assets and an associated liability for amounts
it may have to pay.
If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Company
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the
difference between the carrying amount measured at the date
of de-recognition and the consideration received is recognised
in statement of profit or loss.
**(b) Financial liabilities and equity instruments**
*Classification as debt or equity*
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the
Company are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of
a financial liability and an equity instrument.

*Equity Instruments*
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of
its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
*Financial Liabilities*
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net
of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method where
the time value of money is significant. Interest bearing bank
loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair
value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method. Any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or
redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the
borrowings in the statement of profit and loss.
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from
the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
*i. Financial guarantee contracts*
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are
those contracts that require a payment to be made to
reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified
debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with
the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts
are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for
transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance
of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at
the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as
per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount
recognised less cumulative amortisation.
*ii. De-recognition*
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under
the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange
or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in
the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement
of profit and loss.
*Off-setting of financial instruments*
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net
amount is reported in the standalone balance sheet if there
is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
**p. Derivative financial instruments**
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as
foreign exchange forward to mitigate the risk of changes
in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The
counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank.
**(a) Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair**
**value through profit or loss**
This category has derivative financial assets or liabilities which
are not designated as hedges. Any derivative that is either not
designated a hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as
per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial
liability, at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives not
designated as hedges are recognized initially at fair value and
attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in
the statement of profit and loss when incurred. Subsequent
to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair
value through profit or loss and the resulting gains or losses
are included in the statement of profit and loss.
**(b) Cash flow hedge accounting**
The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward
contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign
exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash
transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the
statement of profit and loss. If the hedging instrument no
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized
in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was
effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the
forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss
previously recognized in the cash flow hedging reserve is
transferred to the net profit in the statement of profit and loss
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction.
If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur,
then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is
reclassified to net profit in the standalone statement of profit
and loss.
**q. Impairment of non-financial assets**
As at the end of each accounting year, the Company reviews
the carrying amounts of its PPE, investment property, intangible
assets and investments in subsidiary companies to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered
an impairment loss. If such indication exists, the said assets are
tested for impairment so as to determine the impairment loss,
if any. Goodwill and the intangible assets with indefinite life
are tested for impairment each year.

Annual Report FY23-24

Impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount
is determined:
(i)
in the case of an individual asset, at the higher of the net
selling price and the value in use; and
(ii)
in the case of a cash generating unit (a group of assets
that generates identified, independent cash flows), at
the higher of the cash generating unit’s net selling price
and the value in use.
(The amount of value in use is determined as the present value
of estimated future cash flows from the continuing use of an
asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. For this
purpose, the discount rate (pre-tax) is determined based on
the weighted average cost of capital of the Company suitably
adjusted for risks specified to the estimated cash flows of
the asset).
For this purpose, a cash generating unit is ascertained as
the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets.
If recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is
estimated to be less than its carrying amount, such deficit is
recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss as
impairment loss and the carrying amount of the asset (or cash
generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss is recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
**r. Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) expenditure**
The Company charges its CSR expenditure during the year to
the statement of profit and loss.
**s. Cash and cash equivalent**
Cash and cash equivalent in the standalone balance sheet
comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits,
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as
they are considered an integral part of the Company’s
cash management.

Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of
an equity share to the extent that they were entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the
reporting period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events such as
bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share split and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the
number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average
number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be issued
on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

**35. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING**
**ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS**
The preparation of the Company's standalone financial
statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the
accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Uncertainty about these assumptions and
estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities
affected in future periods.
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and
future periods affected.
Significant judgements and estimates relating to the carrying
values of assets and liabilities include provision for obsolete
inventory, impairment of investments, impairment of
non-current assets, provision for employee benefits and other
provisions, fair value measurement of financial assets and
liabilities, commitments and contingencies.

**Estimates and assumptions**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are described below. The Company based its
assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the
financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances
and assumptions about future developments, however, may
change due to market changes or circumstances arising that
are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
**a. Income taxes**
The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements
are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose
of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income
taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for
uncertain tax positions.
**b. Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant
proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in
respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining
an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected
residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and
residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the
management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed
periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are
based on historical experience with similar assets as well as
anticipation of future events, which may impact their life,
such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence
arising from changes or improvements in production or from
a change in market demand of the product or service output
of the asset.
**c. Right-of-use assets and lease liability**
The Company has exercised judgement in determining the
lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together
with the impact of options to extend or terminate the lease if
it is reasonably certain to be exercised. Where the rate implicit
in the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing
rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects the
rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow
over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary
to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-
use asset in a similar economic environment. Determination of
the incremental borrowing rate requires estimation.
**d. Impairment of non-current asset including**
**investments**
Determining whether investment are impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the individual investment or
the relevant cash generating units ('CGU'). The value in use
calculation is based on DCF model over the estimated useful
life of the CGU's. Further, the cash flow projections are based
on estimates and assumptions relating to sale price/customer
orders on hand, efficiency in operations etc.
**e. Fair value measurement of financial instruments**
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on
quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured
using valuation techniques including the DCF model. The
inputs to these models are taken from observable markets
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of
judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements
include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit
risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors
could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
**f. Contingencies**
Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of
business in relation to claims against the Company, including
legal and contractual claims. By their nature, contingencies
will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future
events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence,
and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves
the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates
regarding the outcome of future events.
In respect of bank guarantees provided by the Company to
third parties, the Company considers that it is more likely
than not that such an amount will not be payable under the
guarantees provided.
**g. Defined benefit obligations**
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present
value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in
the future. These include the determination of the discount
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed
at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In
determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated
in India, the management considers the interest rates of
government bonds.
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality
tables for India. Those mortality tables tend to change only
at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary
increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future
inflation rates.
Further details about gratuity obligations are given in note 39.

**h. Provision for obsolete inventory**
Inventory write downs are accounted, considering the nature
of inventory, ageing, liquidation plan and net realisable value.
These write downs are recognised as an expense and are
included in “(Increase)/decrease in inventories of finished
goods and work-in-progress" in the statement of profit
and loss.
**i. Expected credit losses on financial assets**
The impairment provisions of financial assets and contract
assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and
expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment
in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past history
of collections, customer’s creditworthiness, existing market
conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of
each reporting period.
**j. Non-current assets held for sale**
Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Determination
of fair value involves management estimate. Fair value of
assets held for sale is determined using valuation technique
involving unobservable inputs. Judgement is involved in
estimating future cash flow, determining discount rate etc.
**k. Employee share based payments**
Company's share based payments to employees primarily
consist of Employee Stock Option Plans ('ESOPs') and
Restricted Stock Units ('RSUs'). The share-based compensation
expense is determined based on the Company's estimate
of fair value at grant date of the ESOPs/RSUs granted. The
Company estimates fair value of ESOPs/RSUs using Black-
Scholes-Merton ('BSM') option pricing model. The BSM model
is based on various assumptions including expected volatility,
expected life, interest rate.
**l. Revenue from Export incentives**
For measurement of income from the export incentives,
significant estimates and judgments are made which include,
eligibility of the export transaction for the claim, the timing of
processing such claim and its subsequent realization and also
the rate notified/to be notified by the government authorities.

a lease, the lease term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable lease payments whether are in-
substance fixed. The judgement involves assessment of whether the asset included in the contract is a fully or partly identified
asset based on the facts and circumstances, whether the contract include a lease and nonlease component and if so, separation
thereof for the purpose of recognition and measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period
of lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the
lease payments are fixed or variable or a combination of both. The Company records the lease liability at the present value of the
lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.

The fair value of the stock options is estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton ('BSM') option pricing model. The
BSM option pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. The
Company recognises share based compensation cost as expense over the requisite service period.
The contractual term of each option granted is ranging from two to three years. There are no cash settlement alternatives. The
Company does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these share options.

The expected life of the share options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of
exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar
to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

**(b) Fair value hierarchy**
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,
grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:
**Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares, and mutual fund investments.
**Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
**Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are
neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available
market data.

(iii) 	 Management uses its best judgement in estimating the
fair value of its financial instruments. However, there
are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the
fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Company could have
realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates.
As such, fair value of financial instruments subsequent to
the reporting dates may be different from the amounts
reported at each reporting date.
(iv) 	 There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3 during the year ended March 31, 2024 and
March 31, 2023.
**(c) Financial risk management objectives and**
**policies**
In the course of its business, the Company is exposed primarily
to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest
rates, equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may
adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The
Company has a risk management policy which not only covers
the foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with
the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and
credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the
Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to:
(i)
create a stable business planning environment by
reducing the impact of currency and interest rate
fluctuations on the Company’s business plan;
(ii) 	 achieve greater predictability to earnings by determining
the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.
**Market risk**
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in
realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may result
from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value
of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity
price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future
specific market movements cannot be normally predicted
with reasonable accuracy.
**(i) Market risk - Interest rate risk**
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure
to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to the Company’s debt obligations with floating
interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by
having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans
and borrowings.
*Interest rate sensitivity*
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and
borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Company’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on
floating rate borrowings, as follows:

1. 12.54
**(ii) Market risk- Foreign currency risk**
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Company’s
operating and financing activities. The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes from investing activities is not material.
The Company manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12 months

*Foreign currency sensitivity*
The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in USD exchange rates, with all other variables
held constant. The impact on the Company’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities.
The Company’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.

The sensitivity analysis has been based on the composition of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities at March 31, 2024 and
March 31, 2023. The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.
**Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading
to a financial loss. Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk and concentration thereof principally consist of trade
receivables, loans receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents.
The carrying value of financial assets represents the maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk was ` 85,024.24
lakhs, ` 64,999.67 lakhs, as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the total carrying value of trade
receivables, balances with bank, bank deposits, investments other than investments in subsidiaries and other financial assets.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Company’s established policy, procedures and control
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual basis
for major customers. The Company does not hold collateral as security.
With respect to Trade receivables, the Company has constituted the terms to review the receivables on periodic basis and to
take necessary mitigations, wherever required. The Company creates allowance for all unsecured receivables based on lifetime

expected credit loss based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is
adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are
due and rates used in the provision matrix.
Credit risk from balances with bank and financial institutions is managed by the Company’s treasury department in accordance
with the Company’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits
assigned to each counterparty. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss
through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Company cannot meet its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk management
is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that funds are available for use as per requirements. The Company has obtained fund
and non-fund based working capital lines from various banks. The Company invests its surplus funds in bank fixed deposit and
government securities, which carry no or low market risk.
The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds on a regular basis. The Company’s objective is to maintain a balance
between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank borrowings etc. The Company assessed
the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low.
The following table shows a maturity analysis of the anticipated cash flows excluding interest obligations for the Company’s
financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differ from both carrying value and fair value:

**Equity Price risk**
Equity Price Risk is related to the change in fair value of the investments in equity securities. Company's investments in equity
securities, including investments held for sale, are subject to changes in fair value of investments. The carrying value of investments
represents the maximum equity risk. The maximum exposure to equity price risk was ` 34,807.65 lakhs and ` 2,074.58 lakhs
as on March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the carrying value (net of provisions) of investments in unquoted
equity shares. The risk is arising primarily on account of the Company's investment in a foreign associate.
**44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**
The Company’s capital management is intended to create value for shareholders by facilitating the meeting of long term and
short term goals of the Company.
The Company determines the amount of capital required on the basis of annual business plan coupled with long term and short
term strategic investment and expansion plans. The funding needs are met through equity, cash generated from operations and
sale of certain assets, long term and short term bank borrowings and issue of securities.

For the purpose of the Company’s capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other equity
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company.
The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the
requirements of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend
payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Company monitors capital using a gearing ratio,
which is total debt divided by total capital plus total debt. The Company’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio at an optimum level
to ensure that the debt related covenant are complied with.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company’s
capital management, amongst other things, aims to
ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the
interest-bearing loans and borrowings that define capital
structure requirements. Breaches in meeting the financial
covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans
and borrowings. There have been no material breaches in
the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and
borrowing for all the periods presented.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes
for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023.
**45.** The Company is in process of taking necessary steps
to comply with the Transfer Pricing requirements relating
to the preparation & maintenance of the Transfer Pricing
documentation with respect to the specified domestic
transactions entered into by the Company during financial
year ended March 31, 2024. The Management is of the
opinion that the specified domestic transactions are at arm’s
length and hence the aforesaid legislation will not have any
impact on the standalone financial statements, particularly on
the amount of tax expense and that of provision for taxation.
**46.** The Company assessed the fair value less cost of sale of
the investment in an associate held for sale. Change in the
regulatory environment and the market conditions effecting
the associate has adversely affected the fair value of the
Company’s investment. The Company has written down the
carrying value of the asset by recognizing an impairment loss
of ` 626.56 lakhs as an exceptional charge during the year
ended March 31, 2019. The Company continues to make
efforts to mitigate the loss by selling such investment in the
near future, which could result in a partial or full reversal
of the impairment loss. Further to related developments
during the year on this matter, including claims filed by the
Company for the recovery, the Company has reassessed that
it is appropriate to reclassify the Investment from ‘Associate’
to ‘Others’.
**47.** The Company had filed petition with the Company
Law Board for compounding of offence u/s. 297 of the
erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 for the transactions entered
with CMS Info Systems Private Limited between July 2009 to
October 2011 and as at date, the petition is pending with the
Company Law Board.
For periods subsequent to October 2011, the Company
had filed an application with Central Government, Ministry
of Corporate Affairs, seeking its approval u/s. 297(1) of
the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 for entering into
contract with CMS Info Systems Private Limited which is
pending approval.
**48.** The Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting
held on May 25, 2023 had recommended a final dividend of
` 1/- (one rupee only) per equity share (i.e. 20% of face value
of ` 5 per equity share) for the financial year ended March 31,
1. 2023. The dividend recommended by the Board of Directors
was approved by the shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting of the Company held on September 20, 2023 and
was subsequently paid.
**49.** During the year ended March 31, 2023, pursuant to
the approval of the Board of Directors, the Company had
concluded the sale of one of its building on leasehold land
and other assets. The transaction had resulted in a gain of
` 605.03 lakhs, which was disclosed as an exceptional item
for that year.

“Business
Combination”

January 03, 2024, the Company acquired 100%
equity shares of ATRACO group ('ATRACO') pursuant
to various share and asset purchase agreements and
on March 13, 2024, Company acquired 100% equity
shares Matrix Design & Industries Private Limited
(‘MDIPL’),The Company has determined that the
acquisition is within the scope of Ind AS 103 ‘Business
Combinations’ which requires that identified assets
and liabilities be recognized at fair value at the date
of acquisition, with the excess of the acquisition
cost over the identified fair value of recognized
assets and liabilities including intangible assets, as
goodwill. The Company appointed independent
professional valuers to perform valuation of assets
for purchase price allocation to the respective assets
and liabilities acquired (hereinafter referred to as
‘the purchase price allocation’ or ‘the PPA’). The
Management of the Company determined that the
fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired was
` 23,316.88 lakhs as part of the PPA. The Company
has identified, ATRACO’s and MDIPL’s customers and
their relationships as intangible assets of ` 3,845.41
lakhs and the consideration paid in excess of the net
assets acquired resulted in recognition of Goodwill
of ` 54,787.46 lakhs. Significant assumptions and
estimates are used as of the date of acquisition
in the determination of the fair values of the
identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
the transaction. Significant judgements were made
by the management of the Company in respect of
the future projections and the discount rate used in
assessing the carrying value of the net assets acquired
and for allocating, purchase price. Accordingly, this is
considered to be a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures in respect of this area included:
1. 1.

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about

is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in
the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements.

responsibilities for Audit of the Consolidated Financial

To the independent auditor’s report on even date on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gokaldas Exports Limited
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
•
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement
of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence
that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for
one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.
•
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to
the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)
(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our
opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements in place and the operating
effectiveness of such controls.
•
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and
related disclosures made by the management and Board
of Directors.
•
Conclude on the appropriateness of the management
and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,
whether a material uncertainty exists related to events
or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
ability of the Group to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the
audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
•
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content
of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial
statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
•
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding
the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express an opinion on the
consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for
the direction, supervision and performance of the audit
of the financial statements of such entities included in
the consolidated financial statements of which we are
the independent auditors. For the other entities or
business activities included in the consolidated financial
statements, which have been audited by other auditors,
such other auditors remain responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the audits carried out by
them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance of
the Holding Company and such other entities included in
the consolidated financial statements of which we are the
independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal
control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a
statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate
with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and
where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with
governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 and are
therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters
in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes
public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely
rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should
not be communicated in our report because the adverse
consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.
**INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL**
**FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE**
**TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS**
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial
controls with reference to consolidated financial statements,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or
fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to
consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject
to the risk that the internal financial control with reference
to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
**OTHER MATTER**
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on
the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal
financial controls with reference to consolidated financial
statements insofar as it relates to six subsidiary companies,
which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the
corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies
incorporated in India. Our opinion is not modified in respect
of this matter.

**1. CORPORATE INFORMATION**
Gokaldas Exports Limited (‘GEL’ or ‘the Company’) (having
Corporate Identity Number(CIN): L18101KA2004PLC033475)
and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’) are mainly engaged in the
business of design, manufacture, and sale of a wide range
of garments for men, women, and children and caters to the
needs of several leading international fashion brands and
retailers. The principal source of revenue for the Group is from
manufacture and sale of garments and related products, both
domestic and overseas.
The Company is a public Company domiciled in India and its
shares are listed on National Stock Exchange and Bombay
Stock Exchange in India. The registered office of the Company
is located in Bengaluru.
**2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**
The significant accounting policies applied by the Group in
the preparation of its consolidated financial statements are
listed below. Such accounting policies have been applied
consistently to all the periods presented in these consolidated
financial statements, unless otherwise indicated.
**2.1 Statement of Compliance**
In accordance with the notification issued by the Ministry of
Corporate Affairs, the Group has adopted Indian Accounting
Standards (referred to as “Ind AS”) notified under the
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and
Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) amendment
Rules 2016, as amended with effect from April 1, 2016. The
consolidated financial statements of the Group, have been
prepared and presented in accordance with Ind AS.
Effective April 1, 2017, the Group has adopted all the Ind AS
standards and the adoption was carried out in accordance
with Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting
Standards, with April 1, 2016 as the transition date. The
transition was carried out from Indian Accounting Principles
generally accepted in India as prescribed under Section 133 of
the Act, read with rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules,
2014 (IGAAP), which was the previous GAAP.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared
on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial assets
and liabilities (refer accounting policy regarding financial
instruments) which have been measured at fair value.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in
Indian Rupees (“Rs”), which is the functional currency of
GEL and all values are rounded to nearest lakhs except when
otherwise indicated.
**2.2 Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at March
31, 2024. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the
investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an
investee if and only if the Group has:
•
Power over the investee (i.e. existing rights that give
it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of
the investee);
•
Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its
involvement with the investee; and
•
The ability to use its power over the investee to affect
its returns.
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting
rights result in control. To support this presumption and when
the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar
rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts
and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an
investee, including:
•
The contractual arrangement with the other vote holders
of the investee;
•
Rights arising from other contractual arrangements;
•
The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights;
•
The size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative
to the size and dispersion of the holdings of the other
voting rights holders.
The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee
if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to
one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation
of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over
the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of
the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of
a subsidiary acquired or disposed off during the year are
included in the consolidated financial statements from the
date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases
to control the subsidiary.
Consolidated financial statements are prepared using
uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other
events in similar circumstances. If a member of the Group
uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the
consolidated financial statements for like transactions and
events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments
are made to that group member’s financial statements in
preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure
conformity with the group’s accounting policies.
The financial statements of all entities used for the purpose of
consolidation are drawn up to same reporting date as that of
the Company, i.e., year ended on 31 March.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)
**200**
Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
**Consolidation procedure:**
(a) 	 Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income,
expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its
subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of
the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets
and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial
statements at the acquisition date.
(b) 	 Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent’s
investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of
equity of each subsidiary.
(c) 	 Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities,
equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to
transactions between entities of the group (profits or
losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are
recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets,
are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an
impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated
financial statements.
(d) 	 Non-controlling interest represents that part of the total
comprehensive income and net assets of subsidiaries
attributable to interests which are not owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Parent Company.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive
income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the
parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests,
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a
deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting
policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All
intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and
cash flows relating to transactions between members of the
Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a
loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the
Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
•
Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities
of the subsidiary;
•
Derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling
interests;
•
Derecognises the cumulative translation differences
recorded in equity;
•
Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
•
Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
•
Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
•
Reclassifies the parent’s share of components previously
recognised in OCI to profit or loss or retained earnings,
as appropriate, as would be required if the Group had
directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
**2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies**
**a. Current versus non-current classification**
The Group presents assets and liabilities in the consolidated
balance sheet based on current/non-current classification. An
asset is treated as current when it is:
•
Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or
consumed in normal operating cycle;
•
Held primarily for the purpose of trading;
•
Expected to be realised within twelve months after the
reporting period; or
•
Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being
exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve
months after the reporting period.
All other assets are classified as non-current.
A liability is current when:
•
It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;
•
It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;
•
It is due to be settled within twelve months after the
reporting period; or
•
There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement
of the liability for at least twelve months after the
reporting period.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current
assets and liabilities.
Advance tax paid is classified as non-current assets.
The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition
of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and
cash equivalents.
The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
**b. Fair value measurement of financial instruments**
The Group measures financial instruments, such as,
derivatives at fair value at each balance sheet date using
valuation techniques.

//FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
**›› 111**
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The fair value
measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction
to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:
•
In the principal market for the asset or liability; or
•
In the absence of a principal market, in the most
advantageous market for the asset or liability.
The principal or the most advantageous market must be
accessible by the Group.
The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing
the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in
their economic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into
account a market participant’s ability to generate economic
benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by
selling it to another market participant that would use the
asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in
the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to
measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured
or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are
categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as
follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement as a whole:
**Level 1:** Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities;
**Level 2:** Valuation techniques for which the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is directly or indirectly observable;
**Level 3:** Valuation techniques for which the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is unobservable.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the
consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis, the
Group determines whether transfers have occurred between
levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
**c. Foreign currencies**
In
preparing
the
consolidated
financial
statements,
transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of
exchange prevailing on the date of transaction. At the end of
each reporting period, monetary items denominated in the
foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at
the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items carried
at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies
are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items are
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are
not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation or settlement
of other monetary items are included in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
The translation of financial statements of the foreign
subsidiaries to the presentation currency is performed for
assets and liabilities using the exchange rate in effect at the
Balance Sheet date and for revenue, expense and cash-flow
items using the average exchange rate for the respective
periods. The gains or losses resulting from such translation
are included in foreign currency translation reserves under
other components of equity. When a subsidiary is disposed
off, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. However
when a change in the parent's ownership does not result
in loss of control of a subsidiary, such changes are recorded
through equity.
**d. Revenue recognition**
**i. Revenue from Contracts with Customers**
Effective April 1, 2018, the Group adopted Ind AS 115
“Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the
cumulative catch-up transition method, applied to contracts
that were not completed as of April 1, 2018. In accordance
with the cumulative catch-up transition method, the
comparatives have not been retrospectively adjusted.
The following is a summary of new and/or revised significant
accounting policies related to revenue recognition.
*Performance obligations and timing of revenue recognition:*
The Group derives its revenue primarily from export of
garments and related products, with revenue recognised at a
point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the
customer. This is generally when the goods are delivered to
the customer/agent nominated by the customer.
There is limited judgement needed in identifying the point
when control passes:
-
once physical delivery of the products has occurred to
the location as per agreement;
-
the Company no longer has physical possession;
-
usually will have a present right to payment (as a single
payment on delivery); and

-
retains none of the significant risks and rewards of the
goods in question.
The Group also derives some revenue from job work contracts.
In these cases, revenue is recognised as and when services are
rendered i.e. the products on which job work is performed is
delivered to the customer at agreed location.
*Determining the transaction price*
The Group's revenue is derived from fixed price contracts and
therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from each
contract is determined by reference to those fixed prices.
There is no significant variable consideration involved.
*Allocating amounts to performance obligations*
For most contracts, there is a fixed unit price for each unit
sold, therefore, there is no judgement involved in allocating
the contract price to each unit.
*Costs of fulfilling contracts*
The costs of fulfilling contracts do not result in the recognition
of a separate asset because such costs are included in the
carrying amount of inventory for contracts involving the sale
of goods.
The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its
Consolidated Statement of Profit and loss.
Advances received from customers are in the nature of
contract liability.
**ii. Revenue from export incentives**
Export incentives are recognised on accrual basis in accordance
with the applicable schemes formulated, by the Government
of India and where there is reasonable assurance that the
enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to them.
**iii. Interest income**
For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost
or at fair value through other comprehensive income (‘OCI’),
interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate
(EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated
future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the
financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate,
to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the
amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the
effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected
cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the
financial instrument but does not consider the expected credit
losses. Interest income is included in finance income in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
**iv. Dividends**
Dividend income on investments is accounted when the right
to receive the dividend is established, which is generally when
shareholders approve the dividend.
**v. Others**
Insurance/other claims are recognised on acceptance basis.
**e. Non-current assets held for sale**
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their
carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale
rather than through continuing use.
The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded met only
when the assets or disposal group is available for immediate
sale in its present condition, subject only to terms that are
usual and customary for sales of such assets, its sale is highly
probable; and it will genuinely be sold, not abandoned. The
Group treats sale of the asset to be highly probable when:
a)
The appropriate level of management is committed to a
plan to sell the asset;
b)
An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the
plan has been initiated;
c)
The asset is being actively marketed for sale at a price
that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value;
d)
The sale is expected to qualify for recognition as a
completed sale within one year from the date of
classification; and
e)
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is
unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made
or that the plan will be withdrawn.
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying
amount and the fair value less costs to sell. Assets and
liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in
the consolidated balance sheet.
**f. Government grants**
The Group recognizes government grants only when there is
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them
shall be complied with, and the grants will be received.
Government grants related to assets are treated as income in
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon fulfilment
of the conditions attached to the grant received. These grants
are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet by deducting
the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the asset.
Government grants related to revenue are recognized on a
systematic basis in the statement of profit and loss over the
periods necessary to match them with the related costs which
they are intended to compensate.
Export incentives are recognized on accrual basis in accordance
with the applicable schemes formulated, by the Government
of India and where there is reasonable assurance that the
enterprise will comply with the conditions attached to them.

**g. Taxes on income**
**Current income tax**
Tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the
year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
consolidated statement of profit and loss because it excludes
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
in other years and it further excludes items that are never
taxable or deductible. Current income tax assets and liabilities
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from
or paid to the taxation authorities. The Group’s liability for
current tax is calculated using the tax rates and tax laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the
reporting period.
Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other
comprehensive income or in equity). Current tax items are
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either
in OCI or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates
positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in
which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation
and establishes provisions where appropriate.
**Deferred income tax**
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable
on differences between the carrying values of assets and
liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of the
taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet
liability model. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised
for all the taxable temporary differences. In contrast, deferred
tax assets are only recognised to the extent that is probable
that future taxable profits will be available against which the
temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible
temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits
and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax
credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be
available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset
to be utilized.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the
tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax
laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit
or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in other
comprehensive income or in equity). Deferred tax items are
recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either
in OCI or directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a
legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to
the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Deferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (‘MAT’)
paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely
to give future economic benefits in the form of availability
of set off against future income tax liability. Accordingly,
MAT is recognised as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet
when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable
that the future economic benefit associated with the asset
will be realized.
**h. Property, plant and equipment (PPE)**
On transition to Ind AS, the Group had elected to continue
with the carrying value of all of its property, plant and
equipment recognised as at March 31, 2016 measured as per
the previous GAAP and use that carrying value as the deemed
cost of the property, plant and equipment as on April 1, 2016.
Freehold land is carried at historical cost and is not depreciated.
Capital work-in-progress and all other property, plant and
equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable
to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included
in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate
asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the
Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The
carrying amount of any component accounted for as separate
assets are de-recognised when replaced. All other repairs
and maintenance are charged to profit and loss during the
reporting period in which they are incurred.
The Group identifies and determines cost of each component/
part of the asset separately, if the component/part has a cost
which is significant to the total cost of the asset having useful
life that is materially different from that of the remaining
asset. These components are depreciated over their useful
lives; the remaining asset is depreciated over the life of the
principal asset.

Depreciation is provided using the written down value method

Leasehold improvements are capitalised at cost and amortized
over their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of
the lease, whichever is less on a straight line basis.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation
of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each
financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant
part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or
when no future economic benefits are expected from its use
or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the
asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in
the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the asset
is derecognised.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial
recognition at cost. Following initial recognition, intangible
assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either
finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful
economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there
is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an
intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at
the end of each reporting period with the affect of any change
in the estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern
of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in
the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period
or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in
accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible
assets with finite lives is recognised in the consolidated
statement of profit and loss unless such expenditure forms
part of carrying value of another asset.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible
asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are
recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss
when the asset is derecognised.
A summary of the policies applied to the Group’s intangible assets is, as follows:

**i. Borrowing cost**
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an
entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the
extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition,
construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or
sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset until such
time as the assets are substantially ready for the intended use
or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period
in which they occur.
**j. Leases**
The determination of whether an arrangement is (or contains)
a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the
inception of the lease. The arrangement is, or contains, a lease
if fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a
specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right
to use the asset or assets, even if that right is not explicitly
specified in an arrangement.
A lease is classified at the inception date as a finance lease or
an operating lease.

For arrangements entered into prior to April 1, 2016, the
Company had determined whether the arrangement contain
lease on the basis of facts and circumstances existing on the
date of transition.
**Group as a lessee**
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and
rewards incidental to ownership to the Group is classified as
a finance lease.
A leased asset is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
However, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group
will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset
is depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of
the asset and the lease term.
Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of the
lease at the inception date fair value of the leased asset or,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments at the
inception of the lease, whichever is lower. Lease payments
are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of
the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are
recognised in finance costs in the consolidated statement of
profit and loss unless they are directly attributable to qualifying
assets, in which case they are capitalized in accordance with
the Group’s general policy on the borrowing costs.
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for
Buildings. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a
lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains,
a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use
of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right
to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses
whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset
(ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii)
the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.
At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group
recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding
lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee,
except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-
term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and
low value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as
an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of
the lease.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented
in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified
as financing cash flows.
**k. Inventories**
**Inventories are valued as follows:**
Raw materials, packing materials, stores, spares and
consumables are valued at lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred
in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
However, materials and other items held for use in the
production of inventories are not written down below cost if
the finished products in which they will be incorporated are
expected to be sold at or above cost.
Work-in-progress and finished goods are valued at lower
of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of direct
materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing
overheads based on the normal operating capacity, but
excluding borrowing costs. Cost is determined on a weighted
average basis. These are valued at lower of cost and net
realisable value after considering provision for obsolescence
and other anticipated loss, wherever considered necessary.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
**l. Provisions and contingent liabilities**
**i. Provisions**
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it
is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable
estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When
the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed,
for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement
is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a
provision is presented in the consolidated statement of profit
and loss net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions
are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of
time is recognised as a finance cost.
**ii. Contingent liabilities**
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises
from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain
future events beyond the control of the Group or a present
obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable

**For the year ended March 31, 2024**
(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)

_Gokaldas Exports Limited
that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the
obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare
cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognised
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not
recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in
the consolidated financial statements.
Provisions and contingent liabilities are reviewed at each
balance sheet.
**m. Retirement and other employee benefits**
Retirement benefit in the form of provident fund, employee
state insurance and pension fund are defined contribution
schemes. The Group has no obligation, other than the
contribution payable to the respective funds. The Group
recognises contribution payable to provident fund, pension
fund and employee state insurance as expenditure, when
an employee renders the related service. If the contribution
payable to the scheme for service received before the balance
sheet reporting date exceeds the contribution already paid, the
deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after
deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution
already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received
before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as
an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for
example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.
All employee benefits payable/available within twelve months
of rendering the service are classified as short term employee
benefits. Benefits such as salaries, allowances and bonus
etc., are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit
and loss in the period in which the employee renders the
related service.
Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation which is funded
through policy taken from Life Insurance Corporation of India
and liability (net of fair value of investment in LIC) is provided
for on the basis of actuarial valuation on projected unit credit
method made at the end of each balance sheet date. Every
employee who has completed 4 years 240 days or more of
the service gets a gratuity on departure at 15 days’ salary
(last drawn salary) of each completed year of service. The fair
value of the plan assets is reduced from the gross obligation
under the defined benefit plans to recognise the obligation on
a net basis.
Accumulated leave, which is expected to be utilized within
the next twelve months, is treated as short-term employee
benefit. The Group measures the expected cost of such
absences as the additional amount that it expects to pay as a
result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the
reporting date.
The Group treats accumulated leave expected to be carried
forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit
for measurement purposes. Such long-term compensated
absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation
using the projected unit credit method at the year-end.
The Group presents the leave as a current liability in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet, to the extent it does not have an
unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months
after the reporting date.
Re-measurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses,
the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in
net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return
on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on
the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or
credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which
they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or
loss in subsequent periods.
Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss on the
earlier of:
a.
The date of the plan amendment or curtailment; and
b.
The date that the Group recognises related restructuring
costs.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the
net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the
following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an
expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss:
a.
Service
costs
comprising
current
service
costs,
past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and
non-routine settlements; and
b.
Net interest expense or income.
**n. Share- based payments**
Employees of the Group receive remuneration in the form of
share-based payments, whereby employees render services
as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled
transactions).
**Equity-settled transactions**
The cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by
the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an
appropriate valuation model.
That cost is recognised, together with a corresponding
increase in share-based payment (SBP) reserves in equity, over
the period in which the service/performance conditions are
fulfilled in employee benefits expense. The cumulative expense
recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting
date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the
vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of
the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The

for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense
recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is
recognised in employee benefits expense.
Service and non-market performance conditions are not
taken into account when determining the grant date fair
value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being
met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate of the
number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market
performance conditions are reflected within the grant date
fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but
without an associated service requirement, are considered
to be non-vesting conditions. Non-vesting conditions are
reflected in the fair value of an award and lead to an immediate
expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or
performance conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest
because non-market performance and/or service conditions
have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-
vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested
irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition
is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service
conditions are satisfied.
When the terms of an equity-settled award are modified,
the minimum expense recognised is the expense had the
terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the
award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any
modification that increases the total fair value of the share-
based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the
employee as measured at the date of modification. Where an
award is cancelled by the entity or by the counterparty, any
remaining element of the fair value of the award is expensed
immediately through profit or loss.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as
additional share dilution in the computation of diluted
earnings per share (except in anti-dilution cases).
**o. Financial instruments**
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the
Group becomes a party to the contract embodying the related
financial instruments. All financial assets, financial liabilities
and financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at
transaction cost and where such values are different from
the fair value, at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly
attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and
financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss) are added to or
deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition
of financial asset or financial liability. Transaction costs directly
attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and financial
liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are immediately
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
**Effective interest method**
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the
amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating
interest income or expense over the relevant period. The
effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts future
cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the
financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.
**(a) Financial assets**
*Financial assets at amortised cost*
Financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost if
these financial assets are held within a business model whose
objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual
cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments
of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
*Financial assets measured at fair value*
Financial assets are measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held within
a business model whose objective is to hold these assets in
order to collect contractual cash flows or to sell these financial
assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise
on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of
principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.
Financial asset not measured at amortised cost or at fair value
through other comprehensive income is carried at fair value
through the consolidated statement of profit and loss. For
financial assets maturing within one year from the balance
sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due
to the short maturity of these instruments.
*Impairment of financial assets*
Loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised for
financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value
through the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
The Group recognises impairment loss on trade receivables
using expected credit loss model, which involves use of
provision matrix constructed on the basis of historical credit
loss experience as permitted under Ind AS 109 – Impairment
loss on investments.
For financial assets whose credit risk has not significantly
increased since initial recognition, loss allowance equal to
twelve months expected credit losses is recognised. Loss
allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses is
recognised if the credit risk on the financial instruments has
significantly increased since initial recognition.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)
**208**
Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
*De-recognition of financial assets*
The Group de-recognises a financial asset only when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset
expire, or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer
qualifies for de-recognition under Ind AS 109.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the
risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the
transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in
the assets and an associated liability for amounts it may have
to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
On de-recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the
difference between the carrying amount measured at the date
of de-recognition and the consideration received is recognised
in consolidated statement of profit or loss.
**(b) Financial liabilities and equity instruments**
*Classification as debt or equity*
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group
are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial
liability and an equity instrument.
*Equity Instruments*
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual
interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its
liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs.
*Financial Liabilities*
Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net
of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at
amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method where
the time value of money is significant. Interest bearing bank
loans, overdrafts and issued debt are initially measured at fair
value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method. Any difference between
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or
redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the
borrowings in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
For trade and other payables maturing within one year from
the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair
value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
*i. Financial guarantee contracts*
Financial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those
contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the
holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to
make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a
debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised
initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs
that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the
amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment
requirements of Ind AS 109 and the amount recognised less
cumulative amortisation.
*ii. De-recognition*
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under
the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms
of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
exchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of
the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The
difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in
the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
*Off-setting of financial instruments*
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net
amount is reported in the consolidated balance sheet if there
is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised
amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to
realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
**p. Derivative financial instruments**
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign
exchange forward to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange
rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for
these contracts is generally a bank.
**(a) Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair**
**value through profit or loss**
This category has derivative financial assets or liabilities which
are not designated as hedges. Any derivative that is either not
designated a hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as
per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial
liability, at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives not
designated as hedges are recognised initially at fair value and
attributable transaction costs are recognised in net profit in
the consolidated statement of profit and loss when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are
measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting
gains or losses are included in the consolidated statement of
profit and loss.

**(b) Cash flow hedge accounting**
The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward
contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of
foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash
transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow
hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair
value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive
income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the
derivative is recognised immediately in the net profit in the
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging
instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,
then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument
recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the
hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve
until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or
loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is
transferred to the net profit in the Consolidated Statement of
Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted
transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer
expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow
hedging reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss.
**q. Impairment of non-financial assets**
As at the end of each accounting year, the Group reviews the
carrying amounts of its PPE, investment property, intangible
assets and investments in subsidiary to determine whether
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an
impairment loss. If such indication exists, the said assets are
tested for impairment so as to determine the impairment loss,
if any. Goodwill and the intangible assets with indefinite life
are tested for impairment each year.
Impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of
an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount
is determined:
(i)
in the case of an individual asset, at the higher of the net
selling price and the value in use; and
(ii) 	 in the case of a cash generating unit (a group of assets
that generates identified, independent cash flows), at
the higher of the cash generating unit’s net selling price
and the value in use.
(The amount of value in use is determined as the present
value of estimated future cash flows from the continuing use
of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.
For this purpose, the discount rate (pre-tax) is determined
based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Group
suitably adjusted for risks specified to the estimated cash
flows of the asset).
For this purpose, a cash generating unit is ascertained as
the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from
other assets or groups of assets.
If recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit)
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, such deficit
is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of
profit and loss as impairment loss and the carrying amount
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its
recoverable amount.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is increased to
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that
the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment
loss is recognised for the asset (or cash generating unit) in
prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.
**r. Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) expenditure**
The Group charges its CSR expenditure during the year to the
consolidated statement of profit and loss.
**s. Cash and cash equivalent**
Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet
comprise cash at banks and on hand and short-term deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less, which are
subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, as
defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts as they are
considered an integral part of the Group’s cash management.

deductions under specific sections of the Income Tax Act,
1961 subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions, as may be
applicable. As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, the Companies
are liable to pay income tax based on higher of regular income
tax payable or the amount payable based on the provisions
applicable for Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT). MAT paid in
excess of regular income tax during a year can be carried
forward for a period of fifteen years and can be offset against
future tax liabilities arising from regular income tax.
Section 115BAA has newly been inserted in the Income Tax
Act, 1961 vide Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019
(subsequently enacted on December 11, 2019 as The Taxation
Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019) which provides a domestic
Company with an irrevocable option to pay tax at a lower
rate of 22% (effective rate of 25.168%) for any previous
year relevant to the assessment year beginning on or after
April 1, 2020. The lower rate shall be applicable subject to
certain conditions, including that the total income should be
computed without claiming specific deduction or exemptions.
MAT would be inapplicable to companies opting to apply the
lower tax rate.
Business loss can be carried forward for a maximum period
of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the
assessment year to which the loss pertains. Unabsorbed
depreciation can be carried forward for an indefinite period.

Basic EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company by the
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Partly paid equity shares are treated as a fraction of
an equity share to the extent that they were entitled to participate in dividends relative to a fully paid equity share during the
reporting period. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period is adjusted for events such as
bonus issue, bonus element in a rights issue, share split and reverse share split (consolidation of shares) that have changed the
number of equity shares outstanding, without a corresponding change in resources.
Diluted EPS amounts are calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted
average number of equity shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of equity shares that would be
issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential equity shares into equity shares.

**34. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS**
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a
material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.

STATEMENTS
**›› 111**
The estimates and the underlying assumptions are reviewed
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and
future periods affected.
Significant judgements and estimates relating to the carrying
values of assets and liabilities include provision for obsolete
inventory, impairment of investments, impairment of
non-current assets, provision for employee benefits and
other provisions, fair value measurement of financial
assets and liabilities, commitments and contingencies.
**Estimates and assumptions**
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key
sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year, are described below. The Group based its
assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the
financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances
and assumptions about future developments, however, may
change due to market changes or circumstances arising
that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are
reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
**a. Income taxes**
The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements
are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose
of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income
taxes, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for
uncertain tax positions.
**b. Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant
proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in
respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining
an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected
residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and
residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the
management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed
periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are
based on historical experience with similar assets as well as
anticipation of future events, which may impact their life,
such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence
arising from changes or improvements in production or from
a change in market demand of the product or service output
of the asset.
**c. Right-of-use assets and lease liability**
The Group has exercised judgement in determining the lease
term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with
the impact of options to extend or terminate the lease if it is
reasonably certain to be exercised. Where the rate implicit in
the lease is not readily available, an incremental borrowing
rate is applied. This incremental borrowing rate reflects the
rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow
over a similar term, with a similar security, the funds necessary
to obtain an asset of a similar nature and value to the right-of-
use asset in a similar economic environment. Determination of
the incremental borrowing rate requires estimation.
**d. Impairment of non-current asset including**
**investments**
Determining whether investment are impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the individual investment or
the relevant cash generating units ('CGU'). The value in use
calculation is based on DCF model over the estimated useful
life of the CGU's. Further, the cash flow projections are based
on estimates and assumptions relating to sale price/customer
orders on hand, efficiency in operations, etc.
**e. Fair value measurement of financial instruments**
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities
recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on
quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured
using valuation techniques including the DCF model. The
inputs to these models are taken from observable markets
where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of
judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements
include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit
risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors
could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.
**f. Contingencies**
Contingent liabilities may arise from the ordinary course of
business in relation to claims against the Group, including
legal and contractual claims. By their nature, contingencies
will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future
events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence,
and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves
the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates
regarding the outcome of future events.
In respect of bank guarantees provided by the Group to
third parties, the Group considers that it is more likely than
not that such an amount will not be payable under the
guarantees provided.
**g. Defined benefit obligations**
The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present
value of the gratuity obligation are determined using actuarial
valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various
assumptions that may differ from actual developments in
the future. These include the determination of the discount
rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the
complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term
nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to
changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed
at each reporting date.
The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In
determining the appropriate discount rate for plans operated
in India, the management considers the interest rates of
government bonds.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees in lakhs, except stated otherwise)
**234**
Annual Report FY23-24
_Gokaldas Exports Limited
The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality
tables for India. Those mortality tables tend to change only
at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary
increases and gratuity increases are based on expected future
inflation rates.
Further details about gratuity obligations are given in note 37.
**h. Provision for obsolete inventory**
Inventory write downs are accounted, considering the nature
of inventory, ageing, liquidation plan and net realisable value.
These write downs are recognised as an expense and are
included in “Changes in inventories of finished goods and
work-in-progress" in the statement of profit and loss.
**i. Expected credit losses on financial assets**
The impairment provisions of financial assets and contract
assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and
expected timing of collection. The Company uses judgment
in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the
impairment calculation, based on the Company’s past history
of collections, customer’s creditworthiness, existing market
conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of
each reporting period.
**j. Non-current assets held for sale**
Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of
carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Determination
of fair value involves management estimate. Fair value of
assets held for sale is determined using valuation technique
involving unobservable inputs. Judgement is involved in
estimating future cash flow, determining discount rate etc.
**k. Employee share based payments**
Company's share based payments to employees primarily
consist of Employee Stock Option Plans ('ESOPs') and
Restricted Stock Units ('RSUs'). The share-based compensation
expense is determined based on the Company's estimate
of fair value at grant date of the ESOPs/RSUs granted. The
Company estimates fair value of ESOPs/RSUs using Black-
Scholes-Merton ('BSM') option pricing model. The BSM model
is based on various assumptions including expected volatility,
expected life, interest rate.
**l. Revenue from Export incentives**
For measurement of income from the export incentives,
significant estimates and judgments are made which include,
eligibility of the export transaction for the claim, the timing of
processing such claim and its subsequent realization and also
the rate notified/to be notified by the government authorities.
**35. SEGMENT INFORMATION-**
**DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO IND AS 108**
**'OPERATING SEGMENT'**
**(a) Basis of identifying operating segments**
Operating segments are identified as those components
of the Group (a) that engage in business activities to earn
revenues and incur expenses; (b) whose operating results are
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer to
make decisions about resource allocation and performance
assessment; and (c) for which discrete financial information
is available.
The accounting policies consistently used in the preparation
of the financial statements are also applied to record revenue
and expenditure in individual segments. Assets, liabilities,
revenues and direct expenses in relation to segments are
categorised based on items that are individually identifiable
to that segment, while other items, wherever allocable, are
apportioned to the segments on an appropriate basis. Certain
items are not specifically allocable to individual segments as
the underlying services are used interchangeably.
**(b)** The Group is engaged  in a single business segment of sale
of garment and hence no additional disclosures are required.
**(c) Geographic information**
The Group mainly operates in two geographical areas of the world, i.e., India and Rest of World, the details of which are as below:

**36. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**
**I. Leases**
The Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease
requires significant judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) include a lease,
the lease term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable lease payments whether are in-substance
fixed. The judgement involves assessment of whether the asset included in the contract is a fully or partly identified asset based
on the facts and circumstances, whether the contract include a lease and nonlease component and if so, separation thereof for
the purpose of recognition and measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of lease
and whether the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease
payments are fixed or variable or a combination of both. The Group records the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.
The movement in lease liabilities is as follows:

The Group does not face a significant liquidity risk with regard to its lease liabilities as the current assets are sufficient to meet
the obligations related to lease liabilities as and when they fall due.
Rental expense recorded for short-term leases during the year is ` 1,700.52 Lakhs (31 March 2023: ` 1,261.22 Lakhs).
**II. Contingencies**
In the ordinary course of business, the Group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Group assesses such claims
and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis with the assistance of external legal counsel, wherever
necessary. The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated
and discloses such matters in its financial statements, if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not
probable, the Group provides disclosure in the financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss
becomes probable.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future sales during the year ended  March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were assessed
to be highly effective and a net unrealised gain/loss relating to hedging instrument is included in OCI. The amounts retained in
OCI at March 31, 2024 are expected to mature and affect the statement of profit and loss during the year ended March 31,

amounts and the Group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
**38. GRATUITY AND OTHER POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS**
The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan. The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the
Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, every employee who has completed four years and 240 days or more of service gets gratuity on
departure at 15 days salary (last drawn salary) for each completed year of service. The level of benefits provided depends on the
member's length of service and salary at retirement age. The scheme is funded with Life Insurance Corporation of India in the
form of a qualifying insurance policy.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expenses recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or
loss and the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for gratuity benefit.

**41. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS**
The Group's employee benefit plans are as summarised below:
In September 2010, the shareholders of the Company approved Stock Option Plan (ESOP 2010) in accordance with the guidelines
issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for Employees Stock Options Plan. The plan covered all employees of
the Group including employees of subsidiaries, directors and provided for the issue of 1,718,800 shares of ` 5 each.
Further, the shareholders of the Company by way of special resolution dated August 26, 2018 approved Employee Restricted
Stock Unit Plan (RSU 2018) in accordance with the guidelines issued by the SEBI for employees Stock Options Plan. The plan
covered all employees of the Group including employees of subsidiaries, directors and provided for the issue of 2,133,040 shares
of ` 5 each.
Further, the shareholders of the Company by way of special resolution dated April 03, 2022 approved Stock Option Plan
(ESOP 2022) in accordance with the guidelines issued by the SEBI for employees Stock Options Plan. The plan covered all
employees of the Group including employees of subsidiaries, directors and provided for the issue of 4,500,000 shares of ` 5
each (increased from 3,000,000 to 4,500,000 options vide special resolution passed by the shareholders on February 29, 2024).
The fair value of the stock options is estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton ('BSM') option pricing model. The
BSM option pricing model incorporates various assumptions including expected volatility, expected life and interest rates. The
Group recognises share based compensation cost as expense over the requisite service period.
The contractual term of each option granted is ranging from two to three years. There are no cash settlement alternatives. The
Group does not have a past practice of cash settlement for these share options.

The expected life of the share options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of
exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar
to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

**(b) Fair value hierarchy**
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value,
grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below:
**Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities. This category consists of investment in quoted equity shares, and mutual fund investments.
**Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
**Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):**
This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data
(unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are
neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available
market data.

(i)
Short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated
at carrying value which is approximately equal to their
fair value.

Fair value of loans (security deposits) having a carrying
amount of ` 3,705.02 lakhs as at March 31, 2024
(March 31, 2023: ` 2,767.62 lakhs) was ` 3,705.02
Lakhs (March 31, 2023: ` 2,767.62 lakhs).
(ii) 	 Foreign exchange forward contracts are fair valued using
market observable rates and published prices together
with forecasted cash flow information where applicable.
(iii) 	 Management uses its best judgement in estimating the
fair value of its financial instruments. However, there
are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the
fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily
indicative of the amounts that the Group could have
realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates.
As such, fair value of financial instruments subsequent to
the reporting dates may be different from the amounts
reported at each reporting date.
(iv) 	 There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2
and Level 3 during the year ended March 31, 2024 and
March 31, 2023.
**(c) Financial risk management objectives and**
**policies**
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates,
equity prices, liquidity and credit risk, which may adversely
impact the fair value of its financial instruments. The Group
has a risk management policy which not only covers the
foreign exchange risks but also other risks associated with the
financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and
credit risks. The risk management policy is approved by the
Board of Directors. The risk management framework aims to:
(i)
create a stable business planning environment by
reducing the impact of currency and interest rate
fluctuations on the Group’s business plan;
(ii) 	 achieve greater predictability to earnings by determining
the financial value of the expected earnings in advance.
**Market risk**
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in
realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may result
from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value
of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes
in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity
price fluctuations, liquidity and other market changes. Future
specific market movements cannot be normally predicted
with reasonable accuracy.
**(i) Market risk - Interest rate risk**
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash
flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to
the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily
to the Group’s debt obligations with floating interest rates.
The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced
portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.
*Interest rate sensitivity*
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and
borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on
floating rate borrowings, as follows:

**(ii) Market risk- Foreign currency risk**
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign
exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the Group’s operating
and financing activities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes from investing activities is not material.
The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging transactions that are expected to occur within a maximum 12 months
period for hedges of forecasted sales.
As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company hedged ` 161,647.03 lakhs (USD 1,910.00 lakhs) and ` 143,037.06
lakhs (USD 1,731.16 lakhs) respectively of it expected foreign currency sales. Those hedged sales were highly probable at the
reporting date. This foreign currency risk is hedged by using foreign currency forward contracts.

The sensitivity analysis has been based on the composition
of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities at March 31,
2024 and March 31, 2023. The period end balances are not
necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding
during the period.
**Credit risk**
Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its
obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract,
leading to a financial loss. Financial instruments that are
subject to credit risk and concentration thereof principally
consist of trade receivables, loans receivables, investments
and cash and cash equivalents.
The carrying value of financial assets represents the
maximum credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk
was ` 68,708.15 lakhs and ` 53,316.70 lakhs, as at March
31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively, being the total
carrying value of trade receivables, balances with bank, bank
deposits, investments other than investments in subsidiaries
and other financial assets.
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject
to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control
relating to customer credit risk management. An impairment
analysis is performed at each reporting date on an individual
basis for major customers. The Group does not hold collateral
as security.

STATEMENTS
**›› 111**
With respect to trade receivables, the Group has constituted
the terms to review the receivables on periodic basis and to take
necessary mitigations, wherever required. The Group creates
allowance for all unsecured receivables based on lifetime
expected credit loss based on a provision matrix. The provision
matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and
is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected
credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables
that are due and rates used in the provision matrix.
Credit risk from balances with bank and financial institutions
is managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance
with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made
only with approved counterparties and within credit limits
assigned to each counterparty. The limits are set to minimise
the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss
through counterparty’s potential failure to make payments.
**Liquidity risk**
Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group cannot meet
its financial obligations. The objective of liquidity risk
management is to maintain sufficient liquidity and ensure that
funds are available for use as per requirements. The Group has
obtained fund and non-fund based working capital lines from
various banks. The Group invests its surplus funds in bank
fixed deposit and government securities, which carry no or
low market risk.
The Group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds on a regular
basis. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between
continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank
overdrafts, bank borrowings etc. The Group assessed the
concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and
concluded it to be low.
The following table shows a maturity analysis of the anticipated cash flows excluding interest obligations for the Group’s financial
liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which therefore differ from both carrying value and fair value:

**Equity Price risk**
Equity Price Risk is related to the change in fair value of the
investments in equity securities. Group's investments in equity
securities, including investments held for sale, are subject
to changes in fair value of investments. The carrying value
of investments represents the maximum equity risk. The
maximum exposure to equity price risk was ` 314.74 lakhs and
` Nil as on March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 respectively,
being the carrying value (net of provisions) of investments in
unquoted equity shares. The risk is arising primarily on account
of the Group's investment in a foreign associate.
**43. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT**
The Group’s capital management is intended to create value
for shareholders by facilitating the meeting of long term and
short term goals of the Group.
The Group determines the amount of capital required on the
basis of annual business plan coupled with long term and
short term strategic investment and expansion plans. The
funding needs are met through equity, cash generated from
operations and sale of certain assets, long term and short
term bank borrowings and issue of securities.
For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital
includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other
equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Group.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements
of the financial covenants. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders,
return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is total debt divided
by total capital plus total debt. The Group’s policy is to keep the gearing ratio at an optimum level to ensure that the debt related
covenant are complied with.

In order to achieve this overall objective, the Group’s capital
management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it
meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans
and borrowings that define capital structure requirements.
Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit
the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings.
There have been no material breaches in the financial
covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing for all
the periods presented.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes
for managing capital during the years ended March 31, 2024
and March 31, 2023.

documentation with respect to the specified domestic
transactions entered into by the Group during financial year
ended March 31, 2024. The Management is of the opinion

**46.** The Group assessed the fair value less cost of sale of
the investment in an associate held for sale. Change in

carrying value of the asset by recognizing an impairment loss
of ` 626.56 lakhs as an exceptional charge during the year
ended March 31, 2019. The Group continues to make efforts
to mitigate the loss by selling such investment in the near
future, which could result in a partial or full reversal of the
impairment loss. Further to related developments during the
year on this matter, including claims filed by the Company for
the recovery, the Company has reassessed that it is appropriate
to reclassify the Investment from ‘Associate’ to ‘Others’.

date, the petition is pending with the Company Law Board.
For periods subsequent to October 2011, the Company
had filed an application with Central Government, Ministry

erstwhile Companies Act, 1956 for entering into contract with
CMS Info Systems Private Limited which is pending approval.
**48.** During the year ended March 31, 2023, pursuant to
the approval of the Board of Directors, the Company had
concluded the sale of one of its building on leasehold land
and other assets. The transaction had resulted in a gain of
` 605.03 lakhs, which was disclosed as an exceptional item
for that year.
